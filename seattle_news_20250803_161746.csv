Despite several high profile departures during his tenure, Harrell has managed to avoid scandals as damaging as those that ended the careers of his predecessors—Ed Murray’s child sex abuse allegations and Jenny Durkan’s missing texts. But now, even in a historically precarious office, the interests that once sought to keep business-backed Harrell out of power, namely organized labor, aren’t currently scouting for a challenger in this election. It’s still early. While the powers that be seem cool with Harrell so far, there’s still time for a strong, pro-worker candidate to emerge before the filing deadline in May. Such a candidate's presence could call into question some progressives' newfound faith in Harrell and force him to answer for his record on not only labor, but housing, homelessness, and public safety. The candidates for the 2021 mayoral race fit neatly into the two familiar lanes of Seattle politics — Harrell represented business, while his opponent, then-City Council President Lorena González, represented labor. The same business interests that paid for Durkan and Murray’s campaigns coalesced around Harrell, spending almost $700,000 in support of him and another $650,000 against Gonzalez, according to the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission. And it seems Harrell has kept big business happy. “Mayor Bruce Harrell’s first term has left our community – including the employer community – feeling very optimistic!” says president and CEO of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce Rachel Smith. Smith cites the Chamber’s latest Index report, which found Seattle voters rated their quality of life and optimism higher than in previous reports. According to Smith, this marks the largest increase in these metrics in the report’s history. Remember, the Chamber doesn’t endorse candidates—they swore off directly organizing PACs after a PR fiasco in which Amazon nakedly tried to buy the 2019 election. But the same donors who supported the Chamber’s previous PACs still pool their money under different banners every year. Still, Smith says, the Chamber believes the increase in optimism “shows that Mayor Harrell’s leadership—leadership that is pragmatic, progressive, and focused on getting the basics right—is moving the city in the right direction.” Smith continues, “Coupled with managing the city budget, helping our community and businesses thrive by addressing public safety and drug use, and seizing opportunities that will benefit the city and region, we’re excited about working with him in 2025 and beyond. In other words, he’s kicking ass.” On the other hand, labor unions may have changed their tune from Harrell’s last election. In 2021, more than 20 progressive unions including UFCW 21 (now UFCW 3000), SEIU 775, Unite Here! Local 8, and the MLK Labor Council endorsed Gonzalez. Unions spent about $440,000 to support her and another $460,000 against Harrell through the Essential Workers For Lorena PAC, SEEC reports. But this time around, labor doesn’t seem so stoked to put up a million dollar fight against Harrell. The reason appears two fold—PACs have limited bandwidth to support candidates and organized labor thinks Harrell’s done an okay job. Next year, Seattle voters will weigh in on not only the Mayor’s race, but the City Attorney's race, two Citywide council seats, and now, the newly vacated District Two seat. Out of the two main, moneyed powers that decide local elections, big business has far superior buying power than labor. And so far, Progressive People Power (P3) PAC has yet to realize its promise of serving as a fundraising supplement to labor— most of its money in the recent election came from SEIU 775. Labor must choose its battles carefully. UFCW 3000 Secretary-Treasurer Joe Mizrahi says that right now, labor is much more focused on finding someone to run against Council President Sara Nelson, but he’s still interested in who might jump in the Mayor’s race in the coming months. So far, SEIU 775 Secretary-Treasurer Adam Glickman says that he hasn’t heard of labor scouting a challenger for Harrell. Labor’s been cozying up with Harrell for some time. In May, MLK Labor Council honored him with a “Labor Oscar” as reward for his “excellent leadership in reaching a deal with the Coalition of City Unions, his support of ‘first-in-the-nation’ workers rights laws in Seattle… his work to ensure that there was a landmark Labor Harmony Agreement on the Seattle Waterfront,” and his “leadership” in passing Building Emissions Performance Standards legislation that will help create hundreds of union jobs. “So we haven’t started an endorsement process yet in the Mayor’s race,” says Glickman. “But I can say that we really appreciate how the Mayor has repeatedly stood up for low wage workers against efforts by this council to undermine labor standards.” He referenced Nelson’s attempt to repeal the gig worker minimum wage and Council Member Joy Hollingsworth’s now-retracted bill to permanently enshrine a tip punishment system. While organized labor has credited Harrell with squashing the council’s attacks on workers’ rights, he never publicly opposed the gig worker minimum wage repeal. And he only called the sunset of the tip punishment system the “right thing for wage fairness” months after Hollingsworth had already withdrawn her bill. This is also the same Mayor who offered City workers a measly 1% raise, tried to strike human service cost-of-living adjustments, proposed cuts to the Office of Labor Standards, and faced accusations of trying to influence the City’s wage theft investigation at the Royal Esquire Club, a private social club where he served as board chair. But the lack of fire under labor’s ass to replace Harrell is not the only indication that Harrell has carved a wide lane for himself in his reelection campaign. Elected officials who previously endorsed Gonzalez have already come out in support of Harrell, including U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) Chair, and State Sen. Joe Nguyen, once dubbed the “AOC” of the Washington State Legislature. Nguyen did not respond to my request for comment. Jayapal calls Harrell a “great partner” to her and her office. She tells The Stranger: “He made a concerted effort to work with me on ensuring we bring the maximum amount possible of federal funding to Seattle for projects that have helped to build more affordable housing, support transportation and infrastructure, and to fight climate change. Mayor Harrell has also been a partner to me in pushing back on the MAGA extremist characterizations of Seattle, and helped me push the facts about how our city is a diverse, welcoming, and progressive place to live and work.” That’s not to say Harrell’s doesn’t have challenges. While he enjoys a relatively high approval rating—43% approval rating in a poll by the Northwest Progressive Institute—he’s also somewhat associated with Republican City Attorney Ann Davison and Nelson, as they ran on a pseudo joint slate in 2021 and have aligned on various issues in recent years. Neither Davison nor Nelson has nearly the popularity, scoring 27% and 22% approval rates respectively in the same poll. Davison has not announced her bid for reelection, so he may not have her baggage to deal with, but Nelson announced her's earlier this week. Harrell’s campaign did not respond when I asked if he plans to endorse Nelson. Additionally, Harrell’s pissed off other, less powerful interest groups in his tenure. Urbanists have criticized Harrell for his lackluster and slow-rolling Comprehensive Plan and lefties have criticized his zeal for sweeping the unhoused and his coziness with the cops. Those groups often align with labor, so if they can produce a strong challenger, the solid foundation Harrell seemed to roll out on may start to fracture.",,"['mayor', 'mayoral', 'city council', 'seattle politics', 'election', 'candidate', 'budget', 'housing', 'homelessness', 'transportation', 'public safety', 'infrastructure', 'legislation', 'mayor (title)']",32.5,2025-08-03T16:16:34.595634,8018

Now we’ll see if Rachael Savage is also an environmentalist. Washington’s Department of Ecology may be wandering into a neighborhood hornet’s nest as it begins the public process on the Stewart House Cleanup Site under its affordable housing grant program. The DESC and the department are entering into an agreement on a state funded cleanup of the site where decades of waste from oil furnaces has accumulated. The Belmont Ave properties home to a trio of former transitional housing buildings from Pioneer Human Services were acquired in a $6.5 million deal last year as the DESC made plans for a new 120-unit apartment building with onsite services for its residents on the block. A 30-day public comment period on the cleanup agreement ends at midnight on May 6th. “Many communities in Washington are facing a housing crunch, but one Ecology program is helping to ease the shortage,” the state’s announcement of public comment window reads. “Our Affordable Housing Cleanup Grant Program provides grants to developers to help clean up contaminated sites. In return, the developers redevelop the property, with at least 40% of the square footage slated for affordable housing for at least 30 years.” The documents from the agreement are posted here. “The properties have historically been the site of apartment buildings heated by oil furnaces. Soil at the cleanup site has been contaminated by petroleum products that leaked out of underground storage tanks,” the state says. “The extent of the contamination will be studied during the future remedial investigation phase.” The state grant process around the projects has been streamlined by the legislature. In 2022, the permanent program was established to provide the grants for planning and cleanup of contaminated sites intended for affordable development. But the process adds another wrinkle to the DESC’s plans in the neighborhood. CHS broke the news on the project this fall as the organization confirmed its planning for “a new Permanent Supportive Housing project” on the parcels it purchased over the summer. King County’s program to fund the projects says permanent supportive housing is housing “for a household that is homeless on entry, where the individual or a household member has a condition of disability, such as mental illness, substance abuse, chronic health issues, or other conditions that create multiple and serious ongoing barriers to housing stability.” City permitting is already approved to demolish the vacant buildings to make way for the new 120-unit DESC permanent supportive housing project. An August fire mostly destroyed one of the buildings waiting to be torn down. Belmont DESC will serve people earning 30% and 50% of Area Median Income who are experiencing chronic homelessness. DESC says its tenants usually earn about 9% to 12% of AMI. The Belmont building will feature only studio units and is being designed for single adult residents. Opposition to the project includes residents and building owners who say the area is already overburdened by the challenges around halfway houses and housing programs for at-risk populations. Broadway business owner and Republican candidate for mayor Rachael Savage made opposition to the plan an early foundation of her “Savage Citizens” campaign. “Capitol Hill already has over three hundred people housed in multiple buildings that operate on this model variously called Housing First, Permanent Supportive Housing or Low Barrier Housing,” Savage said “Our streets are in chaos. We have done enough.” Environmental appeals have become a regular aspect of the long delays faced by development projects around Seattle and, especially, in the city’s largest, most important decisions. CHS reported here as appeals including cases representing Madison Valley, Mount Baker, Hawthorne Hills, and “73 remaining Southern resident killer whales” have gummed up Seattle’s efforts to meet state zoning requirements and arrive at a new 20-year growth plan for the city. The Department of Ecology program, meanwhile, has already been at work in Seattle where a grant-boosted cleanup cleared the way for The Maddux, an affordable project from the Mt. Baker Housing organization just off Rainier. In 2018, the state awarded Mt. Baker Housing $400,000 to start assessing the cleanup project. The legislature later awarded another $6.2 million to finish the project. The cleanup began in June 2020 and took five months to complete. The corner had previously been home to a dry cleaner and gas station. An initial state report on the Stewart House site was completed in 2018. “The presence and/or condition of groundwater has not yet been assessed at the site,” the state’s updated reporting reads. The Department of Ecology is holding a hybrid in-person and virtual “open house” on the project on April 15th. Documents are available online here or in-person from the Capitol Hill library branch.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/06/27/80120394/progressive-revenue-is-not-dead-in-seattle,The Stranger,Progressive Revenue Is Not Dead in Seattle Just Can't Get Enough?,"Seattle electeds have finally realized that they can’t simply rely on the Jumpstart Tax, a progressive (but fluctuating) payroll tax, to backfill budget shortfalls in perpetuity, and they are pursuing new progressive revenue options. I know, I know, this city council and this mayor finding new revenue methods? Our financial outlook is that bad. The Seattle Shield Initiative united an odd duo, Council Member Alexis Mercedes Rinck and Mayor Bruce Harrell. Together, they proposed the initiative to help alleviate the financial stress that a $251 million deficit across all fund balances—and Trump in the White House—will put on the city. The initiative will temporarily raise business and occupation (B&O) taxes to fund programs threatened by the Donald Trump administration, such as investments in housing vouchers, shelters, food and nutrition access, resources for survivors of gender-based violence, and affordable housing. But it gets better. The initiative doesn’t raise the B&O tax for all businesses, only some. Under the initiative, to help bolster struggling mom and pop shops, many small businesses will actually stop paying B&O tax. Sounds pretty good, right? Not if you’re part of a big business organization. The Downtown Seattle Association (DSA, but not the cool one) and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce have already poo-poo’d the proposed initiative. Jon Scholes, president and CEO of the DSA (derogatory) and frequent bad-opinion columnist at the Seattle Times, said in a statement that the Trump tariffs are already bad for business and city leaders are about to “make things worse on local companies” with this new tax. “This proposal is a tax on downtown Seattle’s revitalization and a self-inflicted wound to the progress we’ve been making to attract more businesses downtown and strengthen the city’s tax base. It will make it harder to fill empty tall office buildings and storefronts with companies, which will threaten the commercial tax base and shift more of the tax burden to residents,” Scholes wrote. The Seattle Shield Initiative will raise the B&O tax threshold exemption from $100,000 to $2,000,000 in gross revenue, which means 76 percent of small businesses won’t pay any B&O tax at all. Meanwhile, only businesses earning more than $2 million in revenue will have to pay a higher tax than they did before. According to a press release from the city, “approximately 90% of businesses would owe less than they do today.” Of course, that means those high-earners would shoulder the B&O tax. This is unfair, according to Scholes. “City leaders should heed the lessons from the past and reject boneheaded ideas solely concocted in the name of fighting President Trump,” Scholes wrote. “This rushed tax proposal is bad fiscal policy that will set Seattle back and raise costs for residents.” He had some big, weird feelings (“It’s the fiscal policy version of Seattle’s defund the police movement and if passed will ultimately result in Seattle defunding its tax base,” he wrote on LinkedIn. “This idea should be thrown in the trash bin next to the remnants of defund the police, CHOP/CHAZ, legalizing drugs, etc”) and I’m sure we’ll hear more from him in a forthcoming Seattle Times editorial. But, I must say, this is pretty funny outrage coming from the organization that just pushed policy through the Seattle City Council to put eyesore digital advertising kiosks on Seattle streets. The money earned from those kiosks will go right back into DSA coffers. Maybe they can use some of that money to help their struggling big businesses pay the B&O tax increase. In response to these comments, at a press conference, Harrell said, “We think it’s good policy, and we would disagree [with the DSA].” Remember, this is from longtime DSA (again, not the socialist one) ally Harrell. Do we… gotta hand it to him? “We are not trying to run business out of Seattle, we are open for business,” Harrell, newly anointed fan of progressive revenue (or just a man worried about being another one-term mayor), continued. “So as we look at dealing with a $250 million deficit… The fact is that the state legislature only gives us so many tools, and this is a tool we think along the lines of progressive revenue that is a smart policy to adopt...We will do everything possible to continue to have a healthy business environment, but we stand behind this policy.” In a statement to The Stranger, Mercedes Rinck said, ""It’s true. This proposal progressively shifts B&O tax burden to the largest businesses in Seattle. The top 10 percent will pay more, and the bottom and middle will pay less. I think we can all see that as a worthwhile investment in the local community, workforce, and economy. What will actually set Seattle back is doing nothing while thousands in our community are on the brink of food insecurity and homelessness due to draconian federal cuts."" Wealthy business owner gripes aside, this initiative is a boon for small businesses, according to Jeanie Chunn, community activist, longtime small business advocate, and current candidate for City Council District 2. Chunn, who helped engage small business owners on this initiative for Rinck's office, described how paying fewer B&O taxes will make a huge difference. Especially for businesses operating on the margins like restaurants, having extra funds could pay for much-needed new equipment, new benefits for employees, or repairs. The initiative will provide “much welcomed relief,” she wrote in an email. According to Chunn, most restaurants fall under the $2 million revenue threshold. Even for those who rake in over $2 million annually, they’ll still pay less in local B&O taxes than they do currently because “it's only on sales over $2M.” The Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce jumped to its usual excuses for the reasons we can’t raise taxes: It has some “interesting ideas,” but it’s “rushed,” and companies just can’t afford it right now. “I think the Chamber of Commerce's outrage over this initiative shows that they have and will always represent the interests of large corporations and not locally-owned businesses, small business owners, or the workers of Seattle,” Chunn wrote. ""If the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce only wants to advocate for the preferences of their Emerald and Platinum members, that is their prerogative,"" Mercedes Rinck told The Stranger. ""Local government has responsibility to step up in this moment, and our proposal gives Seattle residents that choice."" However, the Seattle Shield Initiative is not law yet. Rinck will need to curry favor with the other members of the council. They will have to vote on the initiative by Aug. 5. If it's approved, we the people will get to have our say in the November election.

It was a close one. The department reported 84 successful hires in 2024 — one more officer than it lost. Monday, Mayor Bruce Harrell and city officials held a press conference with a bolder mood as officials say SPD’s hiring momentum has continued with 60 officers hired here through April: The 60 officers hired so far in 2025 are more than in the last three years at this point combined. This includes experienced officers who can get started working sooner, with as many lateral hires in 2025 as in the previous five years at this point combined, and as many re-hires as in the last three years combined. Separations are also below the last five years through mid-April. If current trends continue, SPD is on track to hire over 150 officers in 2025, which would be the largest total hires in any year in recent record. Harrell and new SPD Chief Shon Barnes said Monday that the hiring comes on the back of a continued influx of candidates with the department receiving 1,218 officer applications by the end of the first quarter this year, compared to 690 applications at that point in 2024. Harrell, in the early stages of his reelection campaign to keep his office at City Hall, placed the quarter year’s hiring turnaround in context of his administration’s efforts to reform the department and grow efforts like the city’s new Community Assisted Response & Engagement CARE crisis responders while also pushing back on cutbacks or downsizing of SPD despite growing budget gaps and revenue uncertainty for the city. “A well-staffed and well-trained police department is essential to effective public safety in Seattle,” Harrell said. “Our work to modernize recruiting and increase qualified applications is showing results through record hiring in 2025 – putting us on a path to restore Seattle Police Department staffing,” The mayor and City Council president Sara Nelson, also facing reelection, have pushed for a goal of growing SPD’s ranks from the just under 1,000 officers on patrol in 2022 to nearly 1,500 by 2027. CHS reported here on the hiring of former Madison, Wisconsin chief Barnes to lead SPD and his focus on recruitment and retention at the department though large initiatives and smaller issues like infrastructure investments to improve the work environment including smaller upgrades like new carpet and fresh paint. The signs of a turnaround come as Seattle Police officials late last year said the department’s ranks had fallen to the lowest numbers in 30 years as the Seattle City Council expanded a program that pays out a $7,500 hiring bonus to new recruits and boosts bonuses for so-called “lateral” hiring from other police departments to $50,000 as the Harrell administration said Seattle continues to face regional competition for officers. SPD also launched a new recruiting advertising campaign this summer featuring “cartoon versions of police officers in various heroic scenarios.” The campaign is part of a $2.5 million budget in 2025 for police recruitment advertising and marketing. The department has also vowed to improve its recruitment of women even as the city faces ongoing harassment litigation from the department under ousted Chief Adrian Diaz. Publicola reported this week on SPD’s struggles despite its commitment to the “30 by 30” pledge calling for a 30% female recruit class by 2030. Publicola reports that only five of the 60 new hires touted by Harrell Monday are women. Paying cops more is helping. Seattle ranked 29th in the region to start 2024 for base pay for its new recruits an issue the bonus program won’t address. The city and the Seattle Police Officers Guild arrived at a new contract last spring that boosted pay 23%. The city says new recruits now start at a $103,000 a year salary with a $7,500 hiring incentive, and qualified lateral transfers from another agency start at $116,000 with a $50,000 incentive. SPD also says its “average hiring process for police officer candidates” has been streamlined from 5-9 months to 3-5 months. “On average, it takes about a year after graduating from the academy for recruits to become a Seattle Police Officer working an assigned patrol beat,” the city’s report on the hiring success said. Police officer candidates must be at least 20.5 years of age, have a high school diploma or GED equivalent, be generally physically fit, and be able to obtain a Washington driver’s license. There is no upper age limit to apply. In 2023, a 62-year-old joined the force. Monday, officials pointed at citywide crime totals that they say show encouraging public safety trends. CHS reported this month on those totals for the East Precinct that showed Capitol Hill and the Central District have been left out of the rest of city’s dip in reported property crime. East Precinct Violent Crime Report Totals East Precinct Property Crime Report Totals To start 2025 as he begins his campaign for a second term leading the city, Harrell has held up the turnaround in hiring as a key accomplishment of his administration. So far, Harrell’s most significant political challenge has emerged from his political left where progressive activist Katie Wilson is building her campaign around her work leading the Transit Riders Union and minimum wage and renter rights campaigns around the region. The deadline for candidates to file to take part in the August primary is next week. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/07/28/80169410/katie-wilson-is-giving-harrell-a-run-for-his-money-literally,The Stranger,"Katie Wilson Is Giving Harrell a Run for His Money, Literally Just Can't Get Enough?","Since May, Mayor Bruce Harrell has deployed attack ads, hitched his wagon to a progressive tax proposal, and shouted at the The Stranger’s endorsement board, but so far, it seems like it’s too little too late: a new poll from the Northwest Progressive Institute found that Harrell and Katie Wilson are still neck and neck in this race. The poll, based on interviews with 651 likely primary voters, found that when voters were given the information in the King County Voters Pamphlet, 35 percent said they would vote for Wilson, compared to 33 percent that said they would vote for Harrell. When they simulated a general election with the two candidates, 43 percent went for Wilson, and only 39 percent for Harrell. The margin of error for this poll is 4.1 percent, so statistically, the two candidates are tied. What might be more important, though, is where each candidate has room to grow. Andrew Villeneuve, the executive director of NPI, sees Harrell’s incumbency as a disadvantage in this election. Seattle is always looking for fresh blood (we haven’t reelected a mayor since Greg Nichols in 2005), and this year is no different. Harrell’s approval rating is 35 percent, but his disapproval rating is a whopping 44 percent. Wilson’s disapproval rating is only 18 percent, and 48 percent of the respondents didn’t have an opinion on her, which means she has so much more room to win over voters in the general election. Typically an incumbent would hope to be close to 50 percent at this point in the race, Villeneuve said in a press conference Monday morning. ""[Harrell] is in a race for his political life,"" Villeneuve said. ""This is one of the most exciting mayoral races I've ever seen."" Harrell’s campaign has clearly noticed how tight the race is, and they’re starting to go negative. A press release from the campaign two weeks ago claimed that Wilson was “flip flopped” because she declined to endorse Kshama Sawant’s run for Congress, and claimed she was trying to “mislead Seattle voters and make her extreme views palatable to the general public.” And last week, they sent out a mailer that went after her previous endorsements of Sawant and her support for plans to cut police budgets. And while, thanks to the Democracy Voucher Programs spending limits, they’re tied in fundraising, the pro-Harrell PAC’s fundraising has already passed $275,000. Wilson has campaigned with a huge focus on affordability: of rent, childcare, and a slice of pizza. The Stranger asked NPI’s Villeneuve if the results showed that her affordability-focused messaging was resonating with voters. “Yes, focusing on affordability has definitely helped Katie,” he said. He noted that a handful of voters mentioned affordability as one of the central reasons they would vote for her, “but campaigning on lowering Seattleites' costs is not the only reason why she's competing well right now. Wilson's supporters say she brings good political instincts to the table and has a track record of getting results.” Villeneuve pointed to one person who was surveyed—a Black woman between 39 and 49 years old with a graduate degree who lives in Georgetown—as a good example of Wilson’s appeal. ""Katie has worked with so many community partners and leaders,” she wrote. “She is a critical thinker and she is able [to] make a plan and mitigate harm. She is trustworthy because her actions and words match. She understands the challenges the city has and the opportunities to utilize existing resources to help communities and she is thoughtful about progressive revenue. She applies a racial equity lens and she is a strong advocate for renters, anti-displacement, inclusive zoning, [good] jobs and reliable transportation. She knows these investments lead to real public safety... She won't lead with hostility and that tone will improve jobs for city staff."" When reached for comment, the Harrell campaign pointed to “tariff-driven inflation impacting household budgets” as one of his headwinds in the campaign, and emphasized the same notes that are in his negative mailers: Wilson's previous endorsement of Sawant, her support for cutting police budgets, and her opposition to sweeps. “We knew this would be a challenging race,” Harrell said. Wilson took an understated victory lap. “This poll shows what I and our hundreds of campaign volunteers already know from talking with voters across the city: so many people are ready for change,” Wilson told The Stranger. “They know we can’t afford another four years of visionless leadership that puts wealthy interests ahead of everyday working people.” Editor's Note: This story has been updated to include comment from the Harrell Campaign.",,"['mayor', 'mayoral', 'election', 'candidate', 'transportation', 'zoning', 'public safety', 'police']",20.0,2025-08-03T16:16:34.589530,4673

The appointment process sucked; the unimaginative snoozers on the city council selected multiple-SECB-endorsement-loser Mark Solomon to take the seat. Luckily, Solomon isn’t running to keep the seat, so we have an open race on our hands! Which brings us to the pool of four viable D2 hopefuls: Union guy and SDCI inspector Jamie Fackler; restaurant organizer and activist Jeanie Chunn; assistant city attorney Eddie Lin; and mayoral transportation engagement manager Adonis Ducksworth. After a lively (read: tense, yell-y) discussion, the clear choice for D2 is Eddie Lin. As an assistant city attorney, Lin’s focus for the last several years has been working with the Office of Housing. When it comes to housing, and building more of it, Lin knows his stuff. In the midst of a never-ending housing crisis and a new Social Housing Developer on its way through the Seattle Process’s long birth canal, we need someone who can get shit done. Lin knows we need subsidized affordable units, social housing, limited equity co-ops, and everything else under the sun to get people four walls and a roof. Plus, whoever sits on council will implement Mayor Bruce Harrell’s Comprehensive Plan. Lin, a fiend for density and walkable neighborhoods, is a smart choice to kickstart the next 20 years of Seattle’s growth. One of the main hits against Lin, as Fackler repeatedly brought up, was that he didn’t go all out championing Proposition 1A, the voter measure that set up a funding mechanism for the Social Housing Developer. Lin didn't vote for it because, as a housing wonk, he was concerned that it was vulnerable to being undermined by a more conservative, Chamber-backed City Council. However, he says he’s come around and is ready to champion it. He’s also a total slut (sorry, Eddie) for progressive revenue. He’s DFAIT (Down For An Income Tax), a vacancy tax, and a city-level capital gains tax. We liked Chunn’s idea for a commercial vacancy tax, but felt she was still a little too green to hack it in City Hall. We hope to see her again. The other knock against Lin is, like all other candidates except Chunn, he wants more cops. Lin’s desire for increased police presence does go hand-in-hand with hiring a more diverse police force and expanding police alternatives. Plus, Lin’s experience with police brutality made him wary of cops. In his 20s, a Minneapolis police officer cuffed him, put his hands on his throat, and made racist comments—confusing Lin, who is Asian, for a Native American. The rattling experience forever changed Lin’s view of policing. We felt Fackler, while progressive and knowledgeable about the same issues, was too soft on the cops, especially their union. We’re certain Ducksworth will win the Seattle Times endorsement. He’s suave, charming, and doesn’t answer a single question. He’s also fucking cool. Sadly, underneath his skater chic, Ducksworth is nothing but a visionless moderate (read: Bruce Harrell). We already doubted he’d be our guy from the start, and he did us a solid by confirming that with a shitty, uninformed comment blaming drug users for their own predicament. “I did the ride along last week, and these guys asked at least 50 people, are they ready to go to treatment? We got one. We got one. So this comes down to the person on the street, too. Who wants to get off the street,” Ducksworth said. “That’s because some of the treatment options are not—,” Lin said. “They’re not asking about the treatment options,” Ducksworth interrupted. “They’re getting high.” Ducksworth’s mask came off. We did not like it under there. So, Lin is our guy. He’s the whole package. He’s a cat guy and a dog guy. He’s a public schools champion. This is why we willfully turned a blind eye to the fact that he could only name two examples when asked what his four favorite films were and one of them was White Lotus Season 1, famously not a movie. If he’s even seen a movie, he wasn’t paying attention. There weren’t enough housing solutions for his taste. Vote Lin. Editors Note: This endorsement originally appeared in The Stranger's July 2025 issue. In that version, we said Lin voted to support Prop 1A. After publication, his campaign clarified that he voted for 1B in February, but supports the social housing model now. We regret the error. Also, Jamie Fackler's last name is ""Fackler"" not ""Frackler"" (as it appeared in one instance in print). We regret the ""r.""

The latest update comes after last year’s 84 hires as SPD eked out a small victory by bringing on one more officer than it reported losing. The press release from the mayor’s office touts the hundred-hire milestone but doesn’t include statistics on the department’s current ranks. CHS reported here in April as Harrell and new SPD Chief Shon Barnes said that improved hiring totals were being driven by an influx of candidates with the department receiving 1,218 officer applications by the end of the first quarter this year, compared to 690 applications at that point in 2024. The city’s data shows that applications fell slightly in the second quarter to just under 12 qualified applicants per day. The signs of a turnaround have continued as Seattle Police officials late last year said the department’s ranks had fallen to the lowest numbers in 30 years as the Seattle City Council expanded a program that pays out a $7,500 hiring bonus to new recruits and boosts bonuses for so-called “lateral” hiring from other police departments to $50,000 as the Harrell administration said Seattle continues to face regional competition for officers. SPD also launched a new recruiting advertising campaign this summer featuring “cartoon versions of police officers in various heroic scenarios.” The campaign is part of a $2.5 million budget in 2025 for police recruitment advertising and marketing. The department has also vowed to improve its recruitment of women even as the city faces ongoing harassment litigation from the department under ousted Chief Adrian Diaz. The starting salary for a SPD officer is now $103,000 for entry level recruits and $116,000 for lateral officers, Harrell’s office says. The mayor and City Council president Sara Nelson, also facing reelection, have pushed for a goal of growing SPD’s ranks from the just under 1,000 officers on patrol in 2022 to nearly 1,500 by 2027. Barnes, meanwhile, is holding a series of public safety community forums this summer. A date for a District 3 forum for neighborhoods including Capitol Hill, First Hill, and the Central District has not yet been announced. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/02/12/79918008/legislative-sausage-making-at-its-finest-spds-blast-balls-are-back,The Stranger,“Legislative sausage-making at its finest”: SPD’s Blast Balls are Back Just Can't Get Enough?,"Yesterday, the City Council voted six to three to reinstate the Seattle Police Department’s ability to use blast balls, a controversial “less lethal” form of crowd control, on protestors. Mayor Bruce Harrell’s office introduced the bill in October 2024. Councilmembers Cathy Moore, Alexis Mercedes Rinck, and Joy Hollingsworth opposed it, while Council President Sara Nelson and Councilmembers Maritza Rivera, Rob Saka, Mark Solomon, Dan Strauss, and Bob Kettle voted in favor. The use of blast balls was banned by their predecessors in June 2020, in response to the brutal consequences of their use on protestors against police brutality that same summer. However, that ban was never really upheld. Instead, it was put on hold by U.S. District Judge James Robart, who oversees the federal consent decree that the Seattle Police Department has been operating under since 2012. At the time, the Department of Justice and then-SPD Chief Carmen Best argued that not having “less lethal” options would force police to use, uh, more lethal options. “Christina Fogg, an Assistant U.S. Attorney, argued on Friday that without blast balls, pepper spray and other weapons banned by the Council, police would have only ‘batons, tasers and handguns,’” wrote the Seattle Times’ David Gutman, in an article on Robart’s order to block the ban. Robart’s basically said, “Yeah, totally,” instead of what a normal person would say, which is: “Why the fuck would you shoot someone who is unarmed and exercising their First Amendment right to protest, even if they were about to smash a window or sock a cop? Why would you even suggest that!?” And perhaps even: “With that attitude, why the hell do we allow you absolute psychopaths to carry deadly weapons?” A quite frankly upsetting number of sitting councilmembers were also in the, “Yeah, totally,” camp yesterday, but I suppose that’s to be expected these days. Anyway, I won’t bore you with the wonky details, but basically the ban got trapped in legal limbo and never actually took effect. All this time, we’ve been operating under SPD’s existing interim crowd control policies. Indeed, the vote yesterday had a lot to do with getting out from under the consent decree, as nailing down a permanent crowd control policy was one of Robart’s last asks. Given that Mayor Bruce Harrell has made it abundantly clear that he wants to see the consent decree lifted during his time in office, and given the close political alignment he enjoys with the majority of the council, this was pretty much always going to pass. Weirdly, Councilmember Cathy Moore, who shares plenty of politics with Harrell, joined with Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck —who shares politics with precisely none of her colleagues or the mayor— to oppose the bill in its current form. Both spoke to its flaws, and both offered amendments attempting to soften the blow. “I understand the need to move us out of the consent decree, I absolutely support the need to get out of the consent decree, but as I said the first time, we have to get it right,” Moore said. “And I don’t know that the court is necessarily going to believe or find that this is an adequate policy. It’s deeply flawed.” Be that as it may, it’s just that SPD hasn’t had the opportunity, motivation, or explicit permission from the council to use them. Now they do. The important question is, will they? Based on a close read of the new ordinance, there’s no way of knowing. The big takeaway here is that this new “regulation” does very little to actually regulate the behavior of cops when it comes to blast balls, tear gas, pepper spray, and so on. While the bill is packed with very serious-sounding regulations— including a rock-solid, totally enforceable pinky promise, “police use of force for crowd control shall be objectively reasonable, necessary, and proportional to the threat presented” — at the end of the day, when and how to use these incredibly dangerous “less lethal” weapons is left almost entirely up to SPD. Better yet, a lot of it has to do with what an officer thinks is happening from moment to moment. Generally, an SPD Incident Commander or supervisor may still approve anything besides blast balls and tear gas. Once approved, officers must not deploy said tools “unless specific facts and circumstances are occurring or about to occur that create an imminent risk of physical injury to any person or significant property damage.” Nothing further on what those specific facts and circumstances are is included in the bill. For tear gas specifically, the new crowd control bill prohibits it except in situations essentially amounting to a riot (the definition of which is a whole nebula of its own) or a hostage scenario and requires a Mayoral proclamation of civil emergency. As for blast balls, they also carry the same Mayoral proclamation requirement, though they can be used for regular old crowd control, provided, of course, that “specific facts and circumstances establish an imminent threat of violence against persons or significant property damage.” Cops are already supposed to reserve force, and especially deadly force for only situations where it is absolutely necessary, typically in response to immediate threats to their own or a victim’s life. Sounds great, but if their colleagues in Minnesota did that, SPD wouldn’t have had a reason to deploy all the blast balls they deployed in 2020 in the first place. God’s green internet wouldn’t be riddled with videos of innocent people getting shot in the back, beaten to death while they scream for their mother, or lit up while crawling along the ground on their stomach, hands clearly in view. The issue with so much of our regulation around policing is that we’re trusting people who have demonstrated incredibly poor judgment to make important, life-or-death judgment calls. During public comment, Matt Offenbacher, who described himself as a Capitol Hill resident and SODO business owner, brought up the cautionary tale of Captain Steve Strand. “Among other things, he drove his unmarked police car into a crowd of nonviolent climate protestors,” Offenbacher said. “I was one of those protestors, so I can tell you firsthand how shockingly unhinged Captain Strand’s behavior seemed. From the moment he arrived on the scene, his rage led him to escalate his response, greatly increasing the potential for harm and injury.” Noting that his final words from above were not his own opinion, but the actual findings of the Office of Police Accountability, Offenbacher concluded by saying, “I bring Captain Strand to your attention today as a warning that no matter what policies and safeguards you write, councilmembers, if you reauthorize the SPD’s use of less lethal weapons, they will use them and there will be a certain number of officers who, in the heat of the moment, will let their own feelings, their politics, their rage dictate their actions.” Kettle, the bill’s sponsor, later said that “training, training, training” would be key to reincorporating less lethal weaponry in a way that doesn’t harm innocent Seattleites — a handwave if I’ve ever heard one. We have yet to train our way out of what I consider to be the root cause of the rage Offenbacher highlighted, which is that too many police officers see the people they’re supposed to be protecting and serving during protests — the protestors, to be clear, along with everyone else in the vicinity — as the enemy. While I realize this echoes a popular protest slogan, it’s also concerning that so many of the statutes in this “less lethal” weapons policy use imminent property damage as a trigger for the deployment of pretty serious levels of force. Sure, if someone is visibly attempting to maim or kill someone else, and you can prevent it by tossing a blast ball under their feet, I can see an argument for that. But for fuck’s sake, if you’re debating the merits of whether cops should be allowed to cause severe harm and long-term psychological damage to a person — plus all the people around that person — over a plate glass window, what are you even doing on that dias? Perhaps the one thing in this ordinance that could have provided a hard consequence for making the wrong judgment call was Rinck’s Amendment I, which would have created a private right of action to the tune of $10,000 in the event of injury resulting from improper use of blast balls. That right would be denied to anyone who “in the judgment of a reasonable officer, commits a criminal offense at or immediately prior to the use of less lethal force.” Kettle, the bill’s sponsor, was not sold on the idea. “One of the things on this is that there’s already processes available to individuals who felt that they’ve been injured by anybody in the city, nevermind the Seattle Police Department,” he said, “Those processes get the job done, and we should not add to that with this private right of action.” He’s partially right. The city already had to pay $10 million to people injured by less lethal weapons during the 2020 protests. Not that that did anything to steer cops away from such tools. At a Feb. 8 anti-Trump protest on Alki Beach, officers threatened to tear gas and pepper spray protestors who had blocked Alki Ave. Whether or not you believe additional financial penalties would put cops on their best behavior, the amendment went down in flames, with only Rinck and Moore voting in favor. Moore did secure a couple of small concessions. Amendment E added a new recital basically putting down on record that blast balls have a “demonstrated track record” of hurting people who were doing nothing wrong. Amendment D ended up being the only specific, tangible restriction on the use of blast balls, mandating that they only be thrown underhand and away from people, even if it did still include a carveout allowing officers to “deploy blast balls overhand and near a person” so long as they deemed it “reasonable, necessary, and proportional to address immediate threats to life safety.” Silver linings aside, what we are left with is a bill that gives our extremely cop-friendly mayor control over when and how cops are allowed to quell unrest. But once he’s decided a protest is fair game and declared a state of emergency, it’s entirely up to the cops to decide when it’s appropriate to employ “less lethal” weapons. Do not be fooled, nothing in this bill prevents them from doing what they did last time around: shooting first and covering ass later. All they have to do is say that someone was about to do something very bad, an excuse cops have definitely never used to get away with bullshit before. As has become so common under the current Mayor and Council, we have endured yet another situation where people in power quibble on and on and on about something that is ultimately symbolic, with the resulting vote giving SPOG and/or the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce something damn close to whatever they asked for in the beginning. Or, as Saka put it in his closing remarks, “legislative sausage-making at its finest.” I think I’m full.",,"['mayor', 'mayoral', 'city council', 'councilmember', 'police', 'SPD', 'policy', 'ordinance', 'SPD (title)']",19.0,2025-08-03T16:16:34.596634,11070

Pigeon behinds butted over the lip of the building’s roof, pooping with abandon. A person named Bug stood on the small walkway jutting into the park’s reflecting pool and scraped at one of the arched windows, attempting to free Seattle’s new favorite art piece, a guerilla mosaic known as Saint Rat or Hot Rat Summer, from the prison of paint slapped on by the maintenance team at Seattle Public Utilities (SPU). Another person, Cyanasen (the unofficial custodian of the saintly rat), kept watch while smoking a joint. “I come here daily. I hang out with the rat wall and I clean up a lot of stuff and help maintain it,” Cyanesen says. (She says the mosaic is different from Saint Rat, a familiar graffiti tag around town. She calls it Hot Rat Summer.) No one can say exactly when, but sometime last summer a mystery artist cemented the mosaic of a rat standing in profile on multi-hued green grass, a flaming heart near its paw and a halo behind its head, onto the SPU building. Beneath its feet, under the grass, on a background of fire, are the words “Hot Rat Summer.” Seattle University art history professor Ken Allan writes that the piece “refers to Byzantine mosaic tradition in a fun way” and “the use of architecture nicely echoes this.” (Allan told The Stranger that he wants to examine Hot Rat Summer in person and will send more thoughts.) The public loves Hot Rat Summer. It’s a celebration of weird Seattle, of life in the city. Tripadvisor now lists it as a thing to do. The trans community particularly loves the piece. Rats are downtrodden, rejected by society, and harmed for being what they are. That resonates, Cyanesen says. Yet, since the mosaic's (immaculate) conception, the city has waged holy war against it. According to Cyanesen, the rat steward, the city has painted over the piece “eight or nine times,” which Hot Rat Summer enjoyers have scraped off again and again. This battle has seemingly come to an end. After the most recent rat erasure, a public commenter dressed as Saint Rat/Hot Rat Summer showed up to City Hall. City Council Members Joy Hollingsworth and Alexis Mercedes Rinck announced they would personally remove the paint covering the art. At around 2:00 p.m. Wednesday, Rinck and Hollingsworth arrived with a Lowe’s bucket filled with supplies and a ladder to do a job already well underway. Bug had been scraping for an hour and a half, and would stay hours after others left (at 5:30 p.m., Bug was still scraping). And before Bug got there, a “different guy” had put paint stripper on the wall. “This is a beautiful expression about what this neighborhood is all about and this neighborhood has been through it recently,” Rinck says. “These are dark times. Let the people have rats.” Rarely does anything this gold stay in a city hellbent on eradicating unsanctioned public art. Seattle City Council recently passed a law that both raises fines against frequent graffiti taggers to $1,500 and allows the City Attorney to bring civil penalties against them. Rinck was the only one on the council to vote against it. According to Rinck, whether or not this mosaic is different from the graffiti the current mayoral administration and city council majority hates is, like art, subjective. But the only one who can make that determination is Mayor Bruce Harrell, she says. However, it seems like City Attorney Ann Davison and the city council get their say as well. Davison proposed this new graffiti crackdown initiative, but only asked for $1,000 fines. The council’s Public Safety Committee, which includes Bob Kettle, Rob Saka, Joy Hollingsworth, Council President Sara Nelson, and Vacant (the ghost of Cathy Moore), were not satisfied with that sum. It was too low. In the committee meeting, Saka said he proposed his amendment to raise the fine to $1,500 “to make [taggers] hurt financially.” It passed out of committee. Saka and Kettle voted for it, while Hollingsworth and Nelson abstained. Hollingsworth, who voted to pass the bill with the increased fine, says the legislation won’t apply to Hot Rat Summer because it’s public art and “very different from tagging.” “This isn’t someone’s name,” Hollingsworth says. “This is a mosaic.” She then explained what a mosaic was, which The Stranger knew, The Stranger was there. “It reminds me of a stained glass window.” There’s no distinction between mosaics and graffiti in the Seattle Municipal Code, where graffiti is defined as any “unauthorized markings visible from premises open to the public, that have been placed upon any property through the use of paint, ink, chalk, dye or any other substance capable of marking property.” In spite of that, Hollingsworth says she’s been supportive of “stuff like this” since she was elected. Rats? No, no, public art. Last year, she allocated $225,000 in the budget to fund a mural walk (not quite the same thing as a guerilla rat mosaic, but go off). But she says she plans on introducing new legislation that would designate certain city-owned spaces for people to make art. She also wants to repaint the Cal Anderson bathroom in the colors of the trans flag, which was painted to protest the Christian Supremacist rally at the park in May, and zhuzh up the Black Lives Matter memorial on Pine Street. Hollingsworth says Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) “came and covered [Hot Rat Summer] up” multiple times without the council’s knowledge. The Cal Anderson gatehouse is its responsibility, not the responsibility of Seattle Parks and Recreation, which took heat for this. Ultimately, Hollingsworth blames bureaucracy for Hot Ratgate, both why SPU covered the mosaic and why nobody listened when she tried to raise the issue last year. She says she didn’t come out with a paint scraper and ladder because people are mad. She cares. Whatever her motivation, Hollingsworth says Hot Rat Summer is here to stay. “The Parks Department gave me their word, and so did the Mayor’s office, that they’re gonna send a crew out to restore this in the next couple days and professionally seal it,” Hollingsworth says. SPU won’t be fucking around with it anymore either. “Make sure you print this,” she says. “[SPU] have told me that they will do every window on here,” gesturing to the blank gatehouse windows “with some type of work from the community. And the city will pay for it because we’ll pay those artists.” There’s still one important question Hollingsworth wants to know. Who made Hot Rat Summer? Cyanesen just wants them to do a crow mosaic next.

Challenger Katie Wilson seems to have a top-two result all but wrapped up. “This woman is so smart, she’s kicked my ass so many times in so many debates,” repeat mayoral candidate Joe Mallahan said Tuesday night during a candidates forum focused on District 3 issues organized by the Leschi Community Council, the Central Area Neighborhood District Council, and the Coalition of Immigrants Refugees and Communities of Color. Mallahan’s admission — he’s currently running third in fundraising in the race with $122,000 in campaign contributions plus another $15,000 from an independent expenditure committee — made it pretty clear he knows Wilson is going through to November’s General Election. Wilson and incumbent Bruce Harrell’s campaigns have both reported raising around $450,000 each. Harrell is also backed by a $200,000 “Bruce Harrell 4 SeattlesFuture” independent expenditure committee. “We have great values here in Seattle but we often fail to live up to them,” Wilson said Tuesday night in her pitch to the crowd inside Leschi’s Grace United Methodist Church as she positioned her leadership as a collaborative and active effort to push beyond current City Hall leadership’s moderate leanings. Wilson promised an administration that would be more aggressive in galvanizing the city against federal cutbacks and attacks on DEI programs. She said she would back efforts to civilianize more of the work currently saddling the Seattle Police Department, expand alternative responses like the CARE crisis responders, and fix the city’s “broken” police accountability system. And she said she would lead in unity with the city’s community organizations and labor unions — “I’m a believer in the power of organization,” Wilson said. The progressive organizer who is the executive directors of the Transit Riders Union and helped lead minimum wage and renter rights campaigns around the region won the endorsement of the 43rd District Democrats last month. Tuesday night, Harrell “had another appointment and couldn’t move his schedule,” forum organizers told the crowd. In 2021’s primary, voters in Leschi and this area of the city were strong supporters of the Central District born and raised candidate. Harrell’s absence might have been to his advantage. The mayor did not have to respond to the role former T-Mobile executive Mallahan has settled into of Harrell basher with hopes of somehow henpecking the incumbent into third place and out of the race. “I believe the city of Seattle is badly mismanaged,” the repeat mayoral candidate said during one of his times at the microphone, calling Harrell a “disrespectful, vindictive, finger-pointer of a mayor.” You can watch the full candidates forum here.

Today is our last day in the 80s for a while. We’ll slide into the weekend with some perfect Seattle weather in the high 70s, and it’ll last through the first half of next week. Let’s do the news. Who Wants to Build Trump’s Fighter Jets Anyway? More than 3,200 machinists in Boeing’s St. Louis-based defense division are threatening to walk off the job on Sunday and halt production of their military planes. Boeing, who totally isn’t worried about their stock prices, reminded Seattle Times readers that this was just a tenth of the size of last year’s strike in the PNW that tanked their productivity. They also want you to know that this won’t affect production of Trump’s vanity project, the F-47, which is their newest defense contract. Out-of-State PAC Money Rolls into City Council Race: Stranger Staff Writer Nathalie Graham reported yesterday that the National Association of Realtors, a Chicago-based political action committee, already spent nearly $70,000 on mailers for Council President Sara Nelson’s bid to stay on the Seattle City Council. That adds to the more than $400,000 war chest Nelson already has for her campaign to hang onto her council seat. To counter that out-of-state spending, her best competition, Dionne Foster, got some support from Seattle’s progressive PAC, helpfully named Progressive People Power (or P3). As a rule, they don’t get involved until the general, but the Nelson/Foster race got them in the mix early. Toe-to-Toe: New polling from the Northwest Progressive Institute (NPI) showed Foster four points ahead of Nelson with likely voters, once they were provided the information in the voter pamphlet. Those four points are within the margin of error, so statistically, it’s a tie. But with Nelson’s record-low approval ratings, I’d bet she’s feeling nervous. Meanwhile, in the other city-wide council seat, NPI polling found that Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck looks likely to win reelection pretty comfortably, despite the Seattle Times’ refusal to endorse in that race because, as they said, while the candidates were “an interesting group of hopefuls” (a sitting council person) and “very nice,” none of them met their criteria for an endorsement (good). It seems like Republican candidate Rachael Savage sees the writing on the wall, so she’s taking her whole campaign message and turning it into a citizen initiative to ban homeless camping in Seattle and force people to choose between treatment and arrest. The Shield Tax Is Working Its Way Through Council: Yesterday, City Council heard public comment and voted on 17 amendments for the progressive tax code overhaul called the Shield Initiative. Introduced by Councilmember Rinck and Mayor Bruce Harrell, it would eliminate or lower the B&O tax for small businesses, raise the tax for Seattle’s 2,300 highest-grossing companies, and raise $90 million in the process. Public commenters overwhelmingly spoke in support of the bill (the only exceptions being the extremely pro-business Downtown Seattle Association and the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce). A huge number of people working on food access showed up, because under a Trump administration, this initiative could literally be the difference between people eating and not. Council should vote on the full initiative on Monday, just shy of the deadline to get it on the November ballot, and let the people decide. Nuclear Fusion in Everett? The Everett-based company, Helion, announced that it broke ground on the world’s first nuclear fusion power plant. The only problem? It’s not clear if they’ve actually figured out how to turn fusion into power. Maybe that’s a problem for Future Helion. Fernando’s Going Home, for Now: Fernando Alves Rocha, the theater manager at Juanita High School in Kirkland, is expected to be released on a $10,000 bond. He’s been in the Northwest ICE Processing Center for nearly two weeks after immigration officers arrested him in his driveway. They claim he overstayed his tourist visa in 2018. His attorney told KUOW that Rocha filed an asylum application a day before his visa expired in 2018, and that he’s had a valid work permit since his asylum application has been pending. Our Hometown Counterterrorist: Remember when Joe Kent, Trump’s “Young Gun,” was running for Congress in Southern Washington? Well, the former Green Beret and friend to White Supremacists was just confirmed by the Senate as the country’s top counter terrorism official. Trump’s Tariff Tantrums: The deadline for tariffs to come crashing down on every one of our trade partners is tomorrow, so there’s a lot of tariff news: Trump has escalated the fight with Brazil, raising their tariffs to 50 percent and slapping sanctions on the judge that’s investigating Bolsonaro (because dictators look after their own, sometimes); the Administration settled on a 15 percent tariff rate with South Korea; and countries are agreeing to buy more US fuel than they need just to get Trump off their back. And then there’s Canada. Trump said this morning that it would be “very hard” to make a trade deal with our neighbors to the north if they dared to follow in the UK and France’s footsteps and recognize Palestine’s statehood. As a reminder, 147 out of 193 UN member states recognize Palestinian statehood. We’re the problem. Gazans Are Starving and Capitalism Still Rules: Most Gazans depend on aid drops for sustenance at this point, but there are still some operating markets, selling limited produce, pantry staples, and some looted aid package materials. There, a kilo of sugar is more than $100. Baby formula is $51. Let me say that again. Baby formula for starving infants is $51. This Is Fascism: Another Ivy League university has paid off the Trump administration in exchange for being allowed to exist. Brown University agreed to make $50 million in payments to state workforce development programs over the next 10 years, and said they would comply with the Trump administration’s overall ideology, including bans on transgender athletes participating in collegiate sports. Because our federal government is the mob now? Uh Oh, I Agree with the NYT Editorial Board: The New York Times editorial board took a shot at the Supreme Court this week, calling them out for their lack of transparency around their rulings about the Trump administration: Federal judges are not elected by the public. Nor are they supposed to make decisions based on their ideological preferences. Our political system instead vests them with the power to decide whether the president, Congress and other lawmakers are enacting policies that are consistent with previous laws, court rulings and, above all, the Constitution. For these reasons, the credibility of judges depends on their ability to offer public explanation for the legal basis of their decisions…Clear explanation is especially important for the Supreme Court, which sets national rules that lower courts must follow. When the court fails to make these rules clear, confusion can set in. The current Supreme Court is creating precisely this problem by issuing many important rulings as brief, unsigned orders on its so-called emergency docket. On this docket (also known as the shadow docket), the votes among the nine justices are not public, and the majorities typically offer little explanation for their decisions. Yet the justices have used the emergency docket this year to hand down a series of rulings allowing President Trump to expand executive power and alter the structure of government. Preach. I’ll be at the Death Cab for Cutie anniversary show tonight, and Nation of Language is opening for them.

Will They Show Up Today? Just Can't Get Enough?,"However devout your atheism, for the sake of Seattle renters and what’s left of Mark Solomon’s hairline, pray that his city council colleagues actually do on Tuesday what they couldn’t manage at last week’s Housing and Human Services Committee (HHS) meeting: Show the hell up. Last Wednesday, after an 18-month delay, members of the Seattle Renters Commission were scheduled to finally be appointed—and in some cases reappointed—to the city’s volunteer renters advisory board. Commissioners, supporters, and rental advocates filled council chambers anticipating an appointment vote, only for the process to collapse. Neither Council President Sara Nelson nor Councilmember Rob Saka attended, leaving the committee short of quorum. With former chair Cathy Moore having already resigned, the committee could afford to lose no more than two members. “Look, people are volunteering their time. They’re not getting paid for this. We owe it to them to listen and make it happen,” Solomon, the committee’s vice chair, told The Stranger. On paper, the Seattle Renters’ Commission exists to give renters a seat at the table of influence that too often forgets they’re there. It’s charged with advising the Mayor, City Council, and city departments on the policies that shape whether tenants merely scrape by, or live with a shred of stability in a city where north of $128,000 still has many hitting the Grocery Outlet every other week. Nelson had informed Solomon the day before she’d be absent, without offering a public explanation. Saka, citing personal reasons, notified Solomon less than 30 minutes before the 9:30 a.m. start time that he couldn’t attend. Solomon told The Stranger that he believed that the two had legitimate reasons for not showing up, but other council members weren’t as generous. “It’s hard for me to read this as anything other than intentional suppression of representation of renters who are at much higher risk of being displaced. The people in this city deserve people who will actually show up for them and do the work,” Alexis Mercedes Rinck, a member of Solomon’s committee and the only renter currently on the council, told The Stranger. Rinck wasn’t alone in her exasperation. Backlash was swift from renters’ rights and anti-displacement advocates, who saw the absences as yet another attempt to stall a process neglected for nearly a year and a half under Moore’s leadership. During that time, ten of the commission’s fifteen seats went unfilled and nominees received no hearings, even as Moore attempted to advance legislation to roll back tenant protections. “To fail to appoint commissioners in the last scheduled committee meeting before recess is to undermine not only that group’s ability to convene and meaningfully carry out its role: it is to contribute to the sense that ‘government’ has no interest in solving problems of the people, by the people, and for the people,” Alison Eisinger, Executive Director of the Seattle/King County Coalition on Homelessness, wrote in an email to Solomon, Saka, and Nelson after last week’s debacle. Commission confirmations are now scheduled to take place at Tuesday’s full council meeting, along with other business that was delayed due to the absences, including appointments to the Disability Commission. Eisinger had previously pressed Moore on the need to schedule confirmations, calling her refusal to do so a “counterproductive approach to engaging constituents in the work of understanding and addressing the issues and needs of more than 50% of Seattle residents who are renters.” Solomon, who represents South Seattle on the council, says that’s why Tuesday’s meeting is all the more urgent: “That gives us a way forward to seat these folks … we owe it to them to listen and make it happen.” In statements, both Nelson and Saka acknowledged the frustration caused by their absences. For Kate Rubin, a commissioner whose term expired in February and who is seeking reappointment on Tuesday, their excuses rang hollow. “I absolutely believe it was deliberate,” Rubin says. “The email from former Councilmember Moore at 2:30 in the morning confirms it.” The recently resigned Moore’s email directly urged Saka, Nelson, and Solomon to delay the vote, though she later told the Seattle Times that her email to Solomon bounced back. “Beyond that, there’s just been a dismissive attitude toward the Renters Commission since this new council took office,” Rubin says. For renters’ rights advocates, it’s difficult not to interpret last week’s absences, Moore’s witching-hour email lobbying, and her earlier pushes to rollback renter protections and to remake the Renters Commission to include landlords—a shift Rubin says would further muffle the voices of a rental population that now outnumbers homeowners—as anything but a ploy to run out the clock before Moore’s replacement, Debora Juarez, takes office risking further delays in seating the commission. While the Renters Commission is technically advisory, it does weigh in on appointments to Seattle’s Social Housing Authority—the public developer tasked with building, owning, and maintaining permanently affordable mixed-income housing. The council’s conservative bloc has historically resisted Social Housing, pushing an alternative tax measure last year in opposition to it. Rubin says that without the backlash, she doubts the council would have moved with such urgency, fast‑tracking the confirmation for Tuesday instead of letting it languish. Though she’s hopeful it will finally bring long-overdue confirmations, she’s clear that the work is barely beginning. Seattle’s average rent hit $2,110 last month—30 percent higher than the national average, leaving the city among the country’s priciest rental markets. “Fully fund tenant services,” Rubin says. “The people supporting renters are underpaid, overworked, and burning out. Engage renters more in decisions that affect them, not just during 9-to-5 public comment. And create real accountability for landlords. Right now, code enforcement is complaint-based, and landlords can get away with violations just by stopping when they’re caught. Renters deserve a system that actually protects them.” In short, even if all confirmations on the day go forward, it isn’t the finish line. It’s the bare minimum. And if the council can’t manage even that, what hope is there for a city where renters are already running out of money, patience, and most of all, time?",,"['mayor', 'city council', 'councilmember', 'housing', 'homelessness', 'legislation', 'city council (title)']",15.5,2025-08-03T16:16:34.586993,6455

CHS first reported on the plan in December as Deputy Mayor Tim Burgess included the proposal during a public safety meeting with the neighborhood’s business community sparked by ongoing challenges around street crime and drug use around the Broadway-Pike/Pine core and Cal Anderson Park. Last week in a press conference to tout the success of SPD’s Real Time Crime Center, Harrell’s office said the mayor backs an expansion of a pilot program that already has cameras along Aurora Ave, 3rd Ave, and in the International District to include areas around Cal Anderson and Pike/Pine. The mayor’s office is also backing expansion of the 24×7 surveillance program to include the area around Garfield High School where the city and the district are spending thousands on security upgrades and community services to counter deadly gun violence that has marred the campus. Garfield is also being considered for a pilot program beginning this fall that would pay for a Seattle Police School Engagement Officer on the campus. The Harrell administration says it recently proposed legislation to the Seattle City Council that would expand “the geographic areas where City CCTV cameras can be installed, including public streets and sidewalks around Garfield and Nova High Schools, the Capitol Hill Nightlife District, and the SODO Stadium Area,” according to a statement from City Hall. “The legislation also authorizes the RTCC to view and record SDOT traffic cameras at select intersections and along major arterial roads in the city,” the mayor’s office adds. (Image: City of Seattle) The proposed expansion comes as Harrell and new SPD Chief Shon Barnes touted the early success of the RTCC and the pilot creating the new SPD surveillance system combining Closed-Circuit Television Camera systems above the city’s streets with “real-time crime center” software.after only two months of operation. The city says the new system “integrates various video and data streams for enhanced analysis and investigation of crime incidents.” Since its launch on May 20, the upgraded center has played a role in investigating 600 reported incidents and was currently supporting 90 active criminal investigations, officials said last week. According to the city, RTCC analysts provide patrol officers and detectives with incident details, video images, and other relevant information, “often as incidents are happening.” “RTCC analysts can communicate directly with officers in the field via police radio channels,” the city says. “During a recent gun violence incident near Aurora Avenue North, RTCC analysts used CCTV cameras to observe the shooting suspect, send an image of the suspect to responding patrol officers, and then advise officers of the escape route that the offender was taking.” SPD first rolled out the RTCC in 2015 funded through a $411,000 Department of Justice grant. The mayor hasn’t put a public price tag on the new upgraded capabilities of Seattle’s RTCC or the proposed surveillance camera expansions. The addition of the initial set of Aurora, 3rd Ave, and ID cameras was reported as $1.8 million. “Our Real Time Crime Center is already proving to be a vital tool in solving crimes and improving public safety across the city, supporting hundreds of investigations and accountability for dangerous offenders,” Harrell said in a statement. “By investing in and leveraging evidence-based technology, we’re giving our officers the resources they need to respond effectively while ensuring these tools are used responsibly and with strong safeguards. Public safety remains our top priority, and this initiative shows our commitment to creating safer neighborhoods for everyone in Seattle.” “Our Real Time Crime Center is already proving to be a vital tool in solving crimes and improving public safety across the city, supporting hundreds of investigations and accountability for dangerous offenders,” said Mayor Harrell. “By investing in and leveraging evidence-based technology, we’re giving our officers the resources they need to respond effectively while ensuring these tools are used responsibly and with strong safeguards. Public safety remains our top priority, and this initiative shows our commitment to creating safer neighborhoods for everyone in Seattle.” In the East Precinct, SPD has focused on drug issues and street disorder centered around Pike and Broadway and the area around Cal Anderson and Deputy Mayor Burgess’s renewed efforts sparked by neighborhood outcry — and a key email from a neighborhood developer — over an October murder on 11th Ave. (Image: City of Seattle) Burgess said earlier this year his office was working on a plan to add the area around Cal Anderson and Pike/Pine identified by SPD as a trouble zone for drug crimes and street disorder to the anti-crime camera system pilot being rolled out in the area around Aurora Ave N, the International District including Little Saigon, and the 3rd Ave corridor downtown. Other City Hall initiatives including one of its biggest haven’t made much of an impact. CHS reported here on the so far rarely used Capitol Hill Stay Out of Drug Area and the first recipient of a banishment order for the zone. Meanwhile, in the Central District, the 2024/2025 school year at Garfield High School began with new efforts around gun concerns at the 23rd Ave campus and across the city as Seattle officials led by Harrell announced a $14.5 million plan focused on intervention, mental health, and increased use of “school-based safety specialist” private security guards following the deadly lunchtime shooting of teen Amarr Murphy-Paine in June 2024 in the Garfield campus parking lot. The timeline for expanding the cameras to Pike/Pine and 23rd Ave is not clear as chair Bob Kettle must now move the legislation forward with the council’s public safety committee. Harrell, meanwhile, is engaged in a closer than expected race with challenger Katie Wilson as the August 5th primary approaches. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

Mayor Bruce Harrell’s office is explaining away his comments praising Elon Musk and other MAGA-aligned tech leaders last week while addressing the city’s business community at the annual “State of Downtown” gathering. “The mayor was not praising them, he was referencing they have an objective reputation as leaders in technology and innovation, and that it is a danger they are in the president’s orbit,” the mayor’s spokesperson told Publicola trying to explain the praise. “We know that our current president surrounds himself by some of the smartest innovators around,” Harrell said as he veered off script in his business-friendly speech at the Downtown Seattle Association event. “When we drop names like Andreessen or Peter Thiel or David Sacks or Elon Musk, these are smart innovators.” The nuanced praise for Musk in the shadow of his Department of Government Efficiency work to gut major areas of the federal government and his increased efforts supporting right wing campaigns around the globe comes as Harrell is shaping his reelection campaign with themes around “common values,” “public safety solutions,” and “proven leadership to stand up for our values.” With his job going up for a vote, the veteran Seattle politician does not seem interested at this point in engaging in extra tangles with the Trump administration — though his office said the mayor “certainly doesn’t agree with their politics” in the statement provided to media in the wake of last week’s Downtown Seattle Association speech. It will be a tricky row to hoe for Seattle leaders facing reelection in 2025. Monday morning, City Attorney Ann Davison, who ran for Lt. Governor as a Republican in 2020, released a statement calling Seattle a “Welcoming City,” avoiding the “Sanctuary City” label championed in past battles with Trump over immigration, as she announced Seattle will join San Francisco, Portland, “and many other jurisdictions across the country” in filing suit against the Trump administration over its threats to cut to cut federal resources to cities “that do not conduct federal immigration enforcement.” “It is not against the law to be a welcoming city. For more than 20 years, the City of Seattle, by ordinance, has directed its employees to not inquire about a person’s immigration status, absent a legal obligation to do so,” the Davison statement reads. “It is well within our authority to direct our employees in this manner.” Davison announced in January she would seek reelection joining public safety collaborators Harrell and City Council president Sara Nelson on the Seattle campaign trail. In the mayor’s race, meanwhile, none of the candidates lining up to oppose Harrell at this point have the mayor’s name recognition but one of them is being very straightforward in their approach to Making America Great Again. “Calling all MAGA Republicans in WA State. We need your help from outside the blue city,” Harrell challenger and Capitol Hill shop owner Rachael Savage pleaded on social media this week seeking financial support for her campaign. CHS reported here on Savage’s campaign launch as a Republican for the non-partisan mayor’s office as the candidate is promising to lead an end to “the addiction and mental illness epidemic” with a major crackdown in which the city’s police and prosecutors “arrest, charge and convict every person committing crimes on the streets of Seattle no matter how small those crimes are.” $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

Mayor Bruce Harrell has issued an executive order “Supporting and Expediting Sound Transit 3 Investments in the City of Seattle” hoped to help speed construction of new light rail connections to Ballard and West Seattle. Harrell, fresh off the annual “state of the city” address in which he put forward a raft of urbanist and growth initiatives to join his continued messages around addressing public safety and downtown business concerns as he seeks reelection, said his office “will lead the development of and transmit to the City Council legislation to streamline the permit process for this major project,” saying the city will consider “land use code changes, formal adoption of ST3 projects, and supportive property transactions” to “speed up light rail delivery” of the highly anticipated new connections. Let’s check in with the locals. “It still is short on actual details of what kind of zoning changes will be proposed, among other things, saying only ‘In 2025 and 2026, my administration will develop several bodies of legislation, including land use code amendments, formal adoption of the ST3 projects, and necessary real property transactions to allow the projects to proceed as quickly as possible,'” the West Seattle Blog reports, adding that the order “also says that while there’s currently a team with 20 full-time city employees focused on ST3 (the ballot measure that included the West Seattle/Ballard extensions), that will be multiplied.” My Ballard focuses on the money. “To keep the project on track, the City is allocating $5.2 million in 2025 and $6.8 million in 2026 to hire up to 50 additional staff members to focus on design, permitting, construction, and station planning,” My Ballard reports. “The expanded office will also create a four-year plan to ensure safe, accessible stations with thoughtful design, improved access routes, safety measures, and equitable development around transit hubs.” The current timeline calls for the nearly 8 mile light rail extension to Ballard to open by 2039. My Ballard says it will include nine new stations, in addition the needed second downtown transit tunnel, and a Salmon Bay crossing. The West Seattle link will be half as long and is currently planned to be fully delivered by 2032. It is projected to cost between $6.7 and $7.1 billion. The Ballard extension? It is forecasted to cost more than $11 billion. Both extensions were part of the $53.8 billion Sound Transit 3 tax package approved by voters in 2016. Meanwhile, testing efforts — and frequent service disruptions — continue as Sound Transit prepares to open Judkins Park Station and the complete 2 Line light rail system connecting Seattle and the Eastside via I-90 by “late” 2025. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

KUOW reported new details this week from a 1996 incident where the then 37-year-old lawyer working in Nebraska pulled a gun on a man and a woman in a dispute over a parking spot at an Iowa casino. “We was like, ‘What the hell is going on?!” the woman, who was eight months pregnant at the time, told KUOW recalling the incident 30 years later. “It scared us.” KUOW broke the story on Harrell’s 1996 arrest in February but the new reporting provides perspective from the couple on other end of the dispute and details how the case was dismissed and never addressed as Harrell rose at City Hall as a member of the city council and then Seattle’s mayor. The small incident made news at the time, KUOW reports, because Harrell had been appointed to a housing authority board in Omaha. Harrell admitted to “displaying a gun” but said it was because of death threats he received after the appointment. After he was arrested and booked in the gun incident, KUOW says Harrell removed his name for consideration for the board. The case, however, was eventually dropped. Harrell’s spokesperson told KUOW this week the mayor was the victim. “In some ways, this was an introduction to the hostilities the mayor would receive as a public servant, and reminiscent of the treatment and bigotry he has received throughout his life as a biracial person by people of all races and backgrounds who see him as different,” the spokesperson told KUOW. The spokesperson told KUOW Harrell hired a law firm in 1996 “to write to the casino that Harrell’s constitutional rights were violated because of ‘unreasonable search and seizures based on racial profiling'” but no lawsuit was filed. The controversy over the incident is tempered by time and distance but will be another talking point in the 2025 election season. CHS reported here on the challenges Harrell and other Seattle incumbents face standing strong against the Trump administration while also not attracting vindictive attention from Washington D.C. Harrell is shaping his reelection campaign with themes around “common values,” “public safety solutions,” and “proven leadership to stand up for our values.” So far, his field of challengers is limited to candidates with little or no political experience in the city. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/05/02/80039738/the-downfall-of-the-climate-savior-who-never-was,The Stranger,The Downfall of the Climate Savior Who Never Was Just Can't Get Enough?,"There’s a special glee in watching the real-time, self-induced demise of the world’s richest man. Elon Musk, once crowned the boy-king of tech utopianism, has become a tragicomic emblem of what happens when unfettered power meets zero accountability and even less empathy. On Wall Street, his house of electric cards is collapsing: Tesla profits are down 71 percent, shareholders are restless, and even the once-smitten business press are using words like “panic.” And this week, Tesla’s notoriously sycophantic board reportedly—if only for a fleeting moment—considered the heretical notion of replacing him as CEO. In Washington, his soon to be concluded reign as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) leaves a legacy of bureaucratic arson: mass firings, dismantled aid programs, and a chainsaw routine at CPAC that felt like ketamine-laced performance. And still, with the bodies of his bad decisions piling up behind him, Musk went on Fox News to cry about how unfair it all is. He’s no better than a plantation boss bemoaning the loss of free labor, or a robber baron lamenting the bad press after forcefully putting down a strike. Yet, he dares to ask for sympathy. But this isn’t just the fall of a tycoon. No, it’s the flailing, unhinged collapse of a worldview: one that treats governance like a meme, human beings like data points, and compassion as a virus to be eradicated. It wasn’t that long ago that Elon Musk was the liberal poster child for Green capitalism, the magical thinking that climate change, economic stagnation, and job scarcity could all be solved by sleek electric cars and billionaire jaunts to space. In 2015, President Obama used his penultimate State of the Union address to give Musk and his companies a glowing verbal body rub for pushing green tech innovation. Two years earlier, Obama’s Department of Energy handed Tesla a $465 million taxpayer-backed loan, which helped the automaker finally post a profit in 2013. And while liberals went apeshit when Trump turned the White House lawn into a literal “Tesla showroom” during a March event, it’s worth remembering Obama personally toured a SpaceX facility back in 2010 to show his love for public-private bromance in aerospace and renewables. Even before his courtship with the Obama administration, Musk had been glazed by progressive institutions, honored by the National Wildlife Federation, and handed the Global Green Product Design Award by none other than Mikhail Gorbachev. And before he cozied up to Trump, Musk made a brief show of conscience by quitting Trump’s advisory councils over the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord. He even declared “climate change is real” and called the move “not good for America or the world.” Naturally, that principled defiance didn’t stick. And now, Musk’s favorability rating, among everyone, not just liberals, is nestled somewhere between shingles and prostate cancer. His Teslas are dotted with Nazi insignias, and protests against him and his dealerships grow by the week. Besides gifting us gems like “Elon can oligargle dez nutz,” the nationwide protests against the world's richest man may have been the official nail in the coffin in the collective hallucinations that Green capitalism was ever a panacea for our climate and labor crisis, and that Elon Musk was ever anything more than a self-enriching opportunist. “I think the days when people thought we could solve the climate change and crisis by driving an overpriced Tesla are dead,” jokes Thea Riofrancos, Strategic Co-Director of the Climate and Community Institute. Alas, we deified Musk, only for him to unsurprisingly be revealed as a false messiah. There’s already been plenty written about Musk and his fellow tech overlords (Bezos, Zuckerberg, Andreessen), and whether they were always oligarchs in disguise, ready to buddy up beside a conveniently right-wing government (a hard yes on that one). Musk is who he’s always been, which is the same as all high-level capitalists: a self-important, mendacious fuck, willing to choose whatever path is most beneficial to him, all others be damned. As much as we’ve all basked in the collective schadenfreude over the past month—watching Teslas and Cyber Trucks get defaced with Nazi swastikas (which, for the record, is not a hate crime, no matter what the New York Times may suggest), it’s hard not to feel a little twinge of collective complicity. After all, we did allow taxpayer money to flow straight into his pockets in the first place. With Musk, we convinced ourselves we were investing in a climate Messiah, the next ""great man"" who would steer us toward a utopian green future. We imagined he would be the hero of the climate crisis, the one who would save us from ourselves. Instead, we handed him the keys to unfathomable wealth, elevating him to the point where he now wields influence on par with the president. And what does he do with that power? He uses it to decimate anything that threatens his stranglehold on the future. We didn’t bankroll a savior, we created a monster. A monster who has turned the very tools of democracy that enriched him, into weapons to dismantle democracy itself. As the Washington Post recently reported, Musk primarily built his fortune and business empire from $38 billion in public coffers, both from federal and local governments. In fact, he's drawing from the trough again as he stands to be rewarded handsomely from Trump's recently proposed $1 trillion Pentagon budget, which will enrich musk and other defense contractors, while education, arts, Medicaid, Social Security, health and everything else, not in the purview of our oligarchic overlords, stands to suffer. Of course, perhaps it's simply the playbook of most rapacious capitalists propelled up a ladder through luck, stomping on the hands of others and assistance through the public purse, only to set fire to the thing, scorching it whole behind them once they reach the top. “Tesla and SpaceX would not exist today without help from the government. People need to bear that in mind, when governments give tax breaks to billionaires, that means governments either need to spend less on other things, like schools, healthcare, and housing, or they need to raise taxes on the rest of us, so we end up paying for Musk largesse,"" says Jonathan Rosenblum, a longtime labor activist and union organizer with UAW. To Rosenblum’s point, Musk has been draining public resources long before he “volunteered” to lead the Department of Government Efficiency. Every dollar handed to Musk is a dollar diverted from essential public services: schools, transit, and healthcare. The opportunity cost of those subsidies isn’t abstract; it’s real, and it goes straight into his pockets. And it’s done at the expense of workers and unions. “Doge is merely accelerating this track record of theft. In protesting the Tesla brand, people are properly drawing the connection between Musk’s obscene wealth and his thieving ways,” says Rosenblum. It’s true that few have taken more and given less back to the public than Musk. After receiving billions in taxpayer support, Musk has built a business model on suppressing worker organizing. From illegally firing union supporters at Tesla’s California plant to targeting software workers in New York, his managers have followed a consistent playbook of intimidation and retaliation. “People are rightfully angry that the richest man in the world is collaborating with the most powerful man in the world to steal our retirements, our healthcare, and our educational opportunities. Musk is obscenely rich today in part because of the massive public subsidies he has pursued aggressively over the years,” says Rosenblum. Along with other rapacious billionaires, Musk has also led a full assault on the National Labor Relations Board over the last two years. Through his companies, Tesla, SpaceX, and X, he’s repeatedly violated labor law: threatening Tesla workers with the loss of stock options if they unionize, banning union t-shirts on the factory floor, and illegally firing employees at SpaceX and X for organizing or speaking out. These violations led to multiple rulings from the NLRB against Musk’s companies. But instead of complying with the law, he chose a path that reflects a long American tradition: when the rules don’t serve the powerful, fuck it, dismantle the rules altogether. Through SpaceX, Musk filed a federal lawsuit challenging the very constitutionality of the NLRB, which was created during the New Deal to ensure that working people, especially the most underrepresented, had a voice in the workplace. Make no mistake, this wasn’t just a legal maneuver; it was an ideological assault aimed at erasing one of the few remaining tools of federal protection for labor rights. It’s a stark reminder that in this country, the powerful often see accountability as optional, and when facing it, will do everything they can to rewrite the terms of democracy in their favor. Today, Tesla stands as the largest non-union auto manufacturer in the U.S. It’s become a model of how to scale production while locking workers out of a voice on the job. Nor is this just a domestic issue. Tesla has refused to sign collective bargaining agreements even in union-strong countries like Germany and Sweden. That’s what we’re subsidizing with our public dollars: a global campaign against workers' rights. Tesla, despite ranking ninth in earnings among U.S. automakers, commands a $1.25 trillion valuation, largely propped up by the aforementioned public subsidies. A functioning NLRB threatens that business model by giving workers a say in how those government-supported workplaces operate. By working hand in hand with Trump, Musk is pushing an agenda that would gut the NLRB, firing judges, paralyzing enforcement, and rendering union protections meaningless. The goal is clear: create a legal and political environment where companies like Tesla and SpaceX can violate labor law with impunity, silencing workers while continuing to extract billions from the public. If Musk succeeds, it won’t just be his workers who suffer, it will be a decisive blow to what little remains of labor rights in the private sector. What we’re seeing is a coordinated attack on the labor law infrastructure itself, with Musk playing a leading role. With Trump openly dismantling collective bargaining rights for federal workers, nominating anti-union lawyers like Crystal Carey to the NLRB, and firing Board members like Gwynne Wilcox to disable its function, corporate America is being given the green light to ignore labor law altogether. Utah’s recent ban on public sector bargaining and the Michigan case where an employer refused to recognize a union election, citing the chaos at the NLRB, are early signs of what’s to come. Employers like Musk are watching closely and acting quickly. If the courts uphold this unraveling of the NLRB’s authority, we won’t just witness more union-busting, we’ll see the total erosion of the right to organize in America. “Unions, when they’re doing the right thing, are the most effective force for change,” says Kate Bronfenbrenner, a labor scholar at Cornell University and leading expert on unionizing strategies. That’s exactly why she says Musk sees unions as such a threat. His attack on them follows the standard anti-union playbook: surveil, delay, intimidate, retaliate, and then challenge legal frameworks. What sets Musk apart is that he’s scaled up these tactics using the vast resources of his corporate empire along with leveraging the machinery of government to further erode labor protections. “He’s firing people in these agencies meant to keep corporations accountable so that there won’t be any checks and balances,” Bronfenbrenner says. Musk is attempting to deliver the death blow to a labor movement that’s been under attack for decades. The decline didn’t start with him; it was set in motion under Democratic administrations that claimed to support workers while advancing trade deals, deregulation, and immigration policies that weakened labor’s power. Bronfenbrenner is quick to point out that neither President Obama nor Clinton were true friends of labor. The former was the “deporter-in-chief” of immigrant workers, and the latter spearheaded NAFTA, which undermined organized labor and decimated working-class jobs in America. “Unions haven’t been holding Democrats accountable. They’ve been so scared of having anti-union folks in office that they take for granted that Dems will do right by them,” she says. “We can’t dance around the subject anymore. Labor has to have its own party and educate workers.” This is why, at a time when only 6% of private sector workers are in unions—compared to 32% in the public sector—she argues that the public must be educated on what fascist authoritarians of the past did to labor. Figures like Franco and Hitler didn’t just target marginalized communities; they first dismantled unions, understanding that weakening labor was the first step toward unleashing full-scale assaults on broader societal freedoms. “Unions have to stand up for trans workers, and immigrants. The rank and file can’t start thinking they’re safe, they aren’t. They have to have the courage to stand up and be in front of this struggle,” she says. Public protesting and shaming are fine, but what workers and the general public really need to do, according to Bronfenbrenner, is truly hit Tesla, and all corporations that would assail labor rights, where it hurts. “We have to use power, not shame. We have to interfere with supply chains. Whatever you’re doing has to cost enough to a corporation for it to do the right thing,” she says. But the fight against Musk, and whatever corporate misanthrope will come after him, ultimately boils down to whether labor can convince enough of the public that their flourishing is dependent on a greener and more democratic future. “Can’t assume workers want a revolution. Workers want better lives,” says Bronfenbrenner. Don’t we all.",,"['election', 'governance', 'budget', 'housing', 'infrastructure', 'taxes']",14.0,2025-08-03T16:16:34.588549,14076
https://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2025/05/seattle-police-clear-sunbathers-at-denny-blaine-park/,Capitol Hill Seattle,"CHS Capitol Hill Seattle News Seattle Police clear sunbathers at Denny Blaine Park — UPDATE: Mayor, Hollingsworth respond LATEST CHS SUBSCRIBER TOTAL: 1,236","Police were at Denny Blaine Sunday(Image: @mom_calls_me_myrtle) A police officer “on a premise” assignment at Denny Blaine Park caused a stir Sunday at the nude beach east on the shores of Lake Washington. The Seattle Police Department is apparently cracking down on the popular Capitol Hill sunny day getaway. Reports describe multiple police officers called to the scene Sunday telling afternoon park goers to cover up and trespassing one sunbather who refused, according to Colleen Kimseylove of the Friends of Denny Blaine Park community group that has been trying to find solutions that protect the park’s history and place in Seattle queer culture while also placating increasing hostile neighbors in the wealthy neighborhood that surrounds the nude-friendly beach and park that has been affectionately known as Dykiki for decades. “When Kimseylove arrived, they spoke to SPD Officer Ella Brooks who told Kimseylove that no Seattle law protects nudity, and if someone called and complained, SPD officers had to respond,” independent Seattle news site The Burner reports. “The cops also told Kimseylove that someone had directed SPD to routinely check in on the park. They told Kimseylove that people needed to put their clothes on or be trespassed or potentially arrested.” SPD reportedly told one sunbather who argued with officers Sunday they were banned from the park for the week. The department has not publicly provided details of the order. Seattle Parks, whose Park Rangers are authorized to formally trespass individuals for breaking park rules, says it issued no trespasses at the park this weekend. The police presence at the park began just before 2:30 PM Sunday when an officer checked in on East Precinct radio “on a premise” in Denny Blaine Park. Less than five minutes into the beat, she called in for a supervisor. While an officer reporting in “on a premise” can have multiple meanings, it typically indicates an officer is beginning a patrol at an assigned location. Officers check in this way, for example, when SPD is conducting emphasis patrols at specific locations like a school or a business. CHS asked SPD for more information about the incident that followed, the reported trespass, and the premise assignment but the department has not yet responded. The Burner reports it has been told that neighbors have also hired private security to keep watch on the park and deal with police. The apparent crackdown follows filing a lawsuit from unnamed park neighbors demanding the city address concerns at Denny Blaine over “public masturbation, public sex and other types of indecent exposure, drug use, unlawful public nudity, environmental damage to the shoreline, and scofflaw parking.” The suit all but ends any chance at goodwill and compromise the Friends of Denny Blaine group has been forging. The group has been meeting regularly to find community solutions that also protect the park’s place with queer and nudist communities. The friends group successfully pushed back in 2023 on a plan quietly shepherded by Mayor Bruce Harrell to add a children’s playground to the park with the help of a no longer-anonymous donation from Denny Blaine neighbor and Seattle mall developer Stuart Sloan. Sunday, meanwhile, is not the first time officials have tried to change behavior at Denny Blaine. Seattle Parks has tried here and there over the years to timidly suggest sunbathers cover up but never before with cops threatening arrest. Given the city and SPD’s silence on the matter so far, it may not be the last. Sunday’s weather was 60 F and breezy. Tuesday, highs are predicted to approach 80 F before a bout of rain hits the city this weekend. UPDATE: We’ve also reached out to District 3 representative and chair of the city council’s parks committee Joy Hollingsworth to learn more about what is being done to protect community use of the park and will update when we hear back. UPDATE x2: Hollingsworth declined to comment at this time. “Once we receive more information and facts, we will have a better understanding of the situation,” the council member said. UPDATE x3 5/7/2025 8 AM: Hollingsworth says she is “continuing to closely monitor the situation at Denny Blaine Park, particularly in light of the events that took place last Sunday.” In a statement posted Tuesday on social media, Hollingsworth, who is gay, said she recognizes “the deep significance of Denny Blaine to our LGBTQ+ community” and is “committed to preserving and protecting safe, inclusive public spaces for all.” Hollingsworth, chair of the council’s parks committee, says she has been in “active communication” with the Seattle Police Department, Seattle Parks and Recreation, and the Mayor’s Office about the Sunday enforcement, and expressed her concerns over the situation, “underscoring the need for a thoughtful, community-centered approach moving forward.” SPD’s enforcement efforts don’t seem to fit that approach. For now, Hollingsworth is still talking compromise. “My ongoing hope—and priority—is that we can collaboratively develop a solution that respects the park’s unique heritage while ensuring the safety, dignity, and well-being of everyone who visits,” she concludes. Katie Wilson, who is challenging incumbent Bruce Harrell for the Seattle Mayor’s office this year, also added her voice to the condemnation of SPD’s actions, calling the actions a seeming “Plan B” after efforts to change Denny Blaine like plans for the playground were scuttled. “As I’ve been talking with voters around the City, I hear again and again that people want a police force that is adequately staffed but also responsive, trustworthy, and accountable to the communities it serves,” Wilson said in her updates on social media. “It was jarring to read this story about Denny Blaine just after a grocery worker told me about nearly being stabbed on the job and then waiting a very, very long time for police to arrive. What are our priorities? Why are we sending police to harass harmless people hanging out at a queer nude beach?” “Of course, we know why,” she writes. “Because wealthy neighbors don’t want those people there. Just like they wanted the City to build a playground at Denny Blaine to drive them out. And Mayor Harrell’s administration was all set to oblige— until the community organized & pushed back.” “It’s hard to avoid the suspicion that this police prodding is Plan B,” Wilson said. “And it certainly sounds like this strategy is coming from the top. It is mind-boggling that with the multiple major challenges and crises our city is facing, this is what we’re doing.” Harrell, who said he shared “disgust” over the complaints of nudity and lewd behavior at the park in text messages revealed last year, has not yet publicly responded to the Sunday SPD enforcement at the park. UPDATE x4 5/7/2025 9:50 AM: In a statement, the his office say Mayor Harrell has not “directed a change to SPD patrols or approach to enforcement at Denny Blaine Park.” “As we’ve said before, Mayor Harrell recognizes that people have a right to use the park nude under State law,” a spokesperson said. The spokesperson told CHS the mayor’s office would need to “defer to SPD on the details of specific events or any individual enforcement actions taken.” SPD’s communications team has not replied to CHS’s previous inquiries about the situation. We have added them to our conversation with the mayor’s office. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/07/30/80172726/a-conservative-out-of-state-pac-is-backing-sara-nelson,The Stranger,A Conservative Out-of-State PAC Is Backing Sara Nelson Just Can't Get Enough?,"A little more than a week before Seattle’s primary election, the National Association of Realtors, a Chicago-based political action committee, spent nearly $70,000 on mailers for Council President Sara Nelson’s bid to stay on the Seattle City Council. In mailers sponsored by the interest group that only issued an apology in 2020 for its racist funding of the opposition to housing inclusion including the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the NAR calls Nelson a politician with “progressive values.” Progressive? Her? This influx of money and influence is meant to counter Nelson’s extreme unpopularity. Polling in May found that 34 percent of voters disapproved of her job performance. And when voters were surveyed last week, pollsters found that Nelson and her leading opposition, Dionne Foster, are in a dead heat. This is why Progressive People Power, or P3, a political action committee for, you guessed it, progressive values launched last year to support the more progressive candidate in each race. Last year, it was mainly Alexis Mercedes Rinck, who won in a landslide. This year, there is an entire slate of progressive candidates as we head into voting season. “Those candidates work really hard and rise above the fold to get into the general election and then walk face first into a meat grinder of massive corporate spending that drowns out their message and makes it impossible for them to win,” Stephen Paolini, a consultant with P3 says. Since P3 doesn’t endorse, the group’s rule of thumb is to not get involved in the primary. However, P3 is breaking that rule in the District 9 council race against Nelson. Foster is participating in the Democracy Voucher Program, and has raised $290,756.83 in the primary. Nelson's campaign has raised more than $423,000 before the primary, already 70 percent of what she raised between the primary and the general in 2021. And 17 percent of that is from outside of Seattle. Many of her individual contributors are wealth managers, investors, and developers. The $70,000 of PAC money from the NAR (separate from her campaign war chest) isn’t the end, Paolini believes. He thinks it’s only the beginning. “We knew going into this that this would be a heavyweight fight where the business community would be coming in here and writing a blank check to try and keep what has been an extremely unpopular council president in office,” Paolini says, “and we felt it was really important for us to stand up and fight back.” So P3 broke with their (albeit one-year) tradition and began funneling money and resources into Nelson challenger and policy expert Dionne Foster’s campaign weeks before the primary. “This was a race where it’s super clear there's one person that we need to help elevate and support and who's going to be outspent by these out of state groups,” Paolini says. And the group supporting Nelson is one that historically goes ride or die for NIMBYism. At a time when Seattle is dictating the future of Seattle’s development with the Comprehensive Plan, that kind of interest from the NAR may indicate Nelson’s real positions on housing and density. “This is the mask off moment if anybody was wondering what her values truly are,” Paolini says. Likely, nobody was wondering. But, on the flip side, these efforts to beat Foster emphasize her values as well. The people who have funded her confirm that, too. P3 has spent nearly $80,000 on Foster’s behalf so far. According to Paolini, the money P3 spent in this election took over a year to raise from their collaboration with unions and individual donors. Meanwhile, Paolini says groups like NAR can drop that same figure with a snap of a CEO’s fingers. “We need help from, like, lots of people to keep trying to stand up against this kind of powerhouse of an entity,” Paolini says. Editor's Note: A previous version misstated the total contributions Sara Nelson has received. It also stated that Dionne Foster could not spend more than $225,000 on the primary. The campaign informed us after publication that their spending cap has been lifted.",,"['city council', 'election', 'candidate', 'housing', 'policy', 'development']",13.0,2025-08-03T16:16:34.594634,4057

Tuesday night’s Young Democrats at UW Candidate Forum will be broadcast online. Check out @youngdemocrats_uw for details and links. Seattle’s 2025 races for mayor, city attorney, and three seats on the city council will involve Seattle’s wall of mostly moderate Democrat incumbents facing challenges from the left — and a few from the right. One Capitol Hill-based political opponent to Mayor Bruce Harrell won’t be taking him on in the primary. Broadway boutique-owner and Republican neighborhood activist Rachael Savage has opted to file to be part of the race to challenge Alexis Mercedes Rinck for her citywide Position 8 seat on the city council. CHS asked Savage about the change after months of fundraising built around her planned challenge to Harrell. The mayor’s race has drawn eight other challengers to Harrell, however. CHS reported here on the campaign launch earlier this year for progressive activist Katie Wilson who has worked with organizations like the Transit Riders Union, and helped lead minimum wage and renter rights campaigns around the region. On the other side of the spectrum, business friendly candidate and former T-Mobile executive Joe Mallahan is back for a reheat more than a decade after he and Mike McGinn knocked incumbent Greg Nickels out in the city’s 2009 primary. McGinn, of course, battled with Mallahan over things like the plans for the First Hill Streetcar but went on to easy victory that fall. The Savage campaign says the arrival of Mallahan in the race signaled its exit, saying the “last minute entry of millionaire candidate into the race changed the math.” Now, the Savage campaign folks say they have a “winnable race” lined up for the council.

The weather is goddamn beautiful—highs in the 80s and sunny—which is a delightful contrast to everything you’re about to read. Let’s do the news. (If you get to the end, there’s some butt jokes, as a treat.) Trump Is Afraid of Teachers: Last week, ICE arrested and detained Fernando Rocha, a theater manager at Juanita High School in Kirkland. His lawyer told the Seattle Times that Rocha entered the US on a tourist visa in 2018, and before it expired, he applied for asylum. The case is still pending. Meanwhile, ICE Seattle claimed on Twitter that Rocha was wanted in Brazil for theft, a claim that his family in Brazil called “outlandish.” Harrell Wants to Watch You Stumble Home Drunk: Or sunbathe in Cal Anderson. Or go to high school. Last week, Harrell and SPD Chief Shon Barnes claimed that the city’s pilot program for their Real Time Crime Center was a roaring success (ok, Batman). The surveillance program put CCTV cameras along Aurora Avenue North, the downtown Third Avenue corridor, and the Chinatown-International District, and integrated them with their favorite new Automated License Plate Readers into a super secret data center (it’s SPD headquarters). Barnes says they’ve assisted in 90 active criminal investigations in 60 days, but didn’t say what the investigations were (we asked and we’ll report back). Now, Harrell wants to do the same in Cal Anderson, the Capitol Hill Night Life District, and Garfield High School. What could go wrong? Serial Rapist Sentenced in Everett: Christian Sayre, a former Everett bar owner, was sentenced to 109 years for 16 counts of second-degree rape, third-degree rape of a child, indecent liberties, and possession of depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Prosecutors say Sayre used his bar in Everett as a staging ground to prey on his victims. Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said in a statement that it was “one of the most complex and disturbing cases” the department has handled. Sayre’s attorney asked that he get 17 and a half years. The prosecutors asked for 133. Judge Millie Judge (not a typo) went with 109, citing the length and breadth of Sayre’s crimes. WA Child Welfare Isn’t So Well: According to the office that oversees the Department of Children, Youth, and Families, critical injuries for kids in the state’s welfare system took a huge jump in the first half of this year. By the end of June, at least 92 children had died or nearly died, up from 78 in the first six months of 2024. Some Republicans are trying to blame the bipartisan Keep Families Together Act, but fentanyl is the likelier culprit. So far this year, 20 of the cases involving kids under 4 years old were caused by accidental fentanyl exposure. Blue Angel Blues: We’re approaching the season when literal fighter jets swoop around our city like a playground, and some Seattleites are over it. The Airshow Climate Action coalition put up a new billboard on Rainier Ave that reads: “SAY NO TO BLUE ANGELS.” Think of the rescue dogs! Think of the military trauma! Or think of the 670 tons of carbon emissions they blow through in one weekend. Crunching Some Numbers: We’re well into Primary Election Season, so we at The Stranger decided to take another look at the money Katie Wilson and Bruce Harrell have taken in. As we’ve reported before, the two are neck and neck in fundraising, but we noticed a couple key differences. First, almost $60,000 of Harrell’s donations came from outside of Seattle (the city he’d like to keep governing), compared to Wilson’s $7,207. And among his donors, 19 of them are CEOs. (The only time “chief” comes up in Katie’s donor list is a Chief Policy and Strategy Officer for the Highline School District.) I’m just gonna put this thread from Mark Ostrow here. Ok the mayor is speaking. “I embrace the wealthy.”[image or embed] — Qagggy! (@qagggy.bsky.social) July 22, 2025 at 6:26 PM A Little Brain Break: In lighter news, we sent Stranger Staff Writer Audrey Vann, a non-Katy Perry fan, to Monday’s Katy Perry concert at Climate Pledge. She learned a lot. “Before winning me over with an emotional performance of ‘Pearl,’ she had lost me with a megachurch-style sermon about her space voyage,” Vann writes. “She had long dreamed of going to space, she said, and despite her dreams being dismissed, she feels that she ultimately ‘manifested’ her trip on Blue Origin. ‘Part of me did it so that I could let go of any last bit of fear that I had, because I knew that was when my life would begin again,’ she said, tearing up. ‘And to any other girl that has a dream, you go and do it!’ This drew attention to a major discrepancy in her brand regarding female empowerment—she preaches and sings about overcoming adversity (see: ‘Roar and ‘Rise’), but the things she has overcome in her life are deeply unrelatable.” Plus, we got a new list of Katyisms out of the deal: “I’m a Scorpio, bitch!”“Is the internet real, or is this what’s real?”“I dedicate [‘I Kissed A Girl’] to the community—the ones who raised me, the ones that called me out, and the ones that educated me, and for all the little girls in between like myself.”“Love is love! It’s not a gender, it’s a frequency, so tap into it, baby!”“What’s up, Amazon family?” And if you still need a breath before we get into national and international news, spend some time in a basement with The Stranger’s Charles Mudede. Fascism Is Tacky: The administration that populates its Instagram feed with AI-generated images of eagles, money, and the DJT Jerk Off Dance just withdrew from UNESCO, the UN’s cultural agency. This is the second time in as many terms that Trump has pulled us out of the organization. In a comment to the New York Times, a State Department spokesperson accused UNESCO of promoting “divisive social and cultural causes” (Palestinians’ right to exist, mostly) and maintaining an “outsized focus on the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals, a globalist, ideological agenda” at odds “with our America First foreign policy.” Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to rename the Kennedy Center’s Opera House after Melania. Apparently this is art now. No Charges for Bad Cops: You’ve probably seen the video already. Sheriff’s officers in Jacksonville, Florida, pulled William Anthony McNeil Jr. over for not having his headlights on and not wearing a seatbelt. When McNeal questioned why he was pulled over and refused to get out of the car, an officer smashed his window, punched him in the face, wrestled him out of the car, punched him again, and forced him to the ground while shouting “Stop resisting!” Prosecutors say that the officers didn’t break the law, and the Sheriff’s office is still investigating to see if any internal policies were violated. Sheriff T.K. Waters said the cellphone video doesn’t tell the full story. “Cameras can only capture what can be seen and heard,” he said at a news conference Monday. “So much context and depth are absent from recorded footage because a camera simply cannot capture what is known to the people depicted in it.” Don’t worry, T.K., it captured the racism just fine. Israel Strikes WHO Site: Israel attacked a World Health Organization’s site in central Gaza, an area that Israel has largely avoided because it believed Israeli hostages were being held there. Israel doesn’t deny raiding the facility but said any “suspects” had been treated “in accordance with international law.” Whatever the fuck that means at this point. Don’t Put That Up There: A Tokyo-based designer made a butt plug bottle with an egg-shaped, rounded bottom designed to nestle into the sand on the beach, and presented it at the 2nd International Conference on Design for Ocean Environments, which sounds very respectable. But as Mathew Rodriguez wrote for Them: “Murphy’s law tells us that what can go wrong will go wrong. Godwin’s law says that any online discussion will eventually devolve into one person comparing the other to a Nazi. To this esteemed list, let me add Gere’s law, named, of course, after the long-debunked but persistent myth that actor Richard Gere once stuck a gerbil up his butt: If it looks like someone can put it up their butt, they’ll want to.” View this post on Instagram A post shared by Kenji Abe (@kenji_abe_) Never Say Die: John Michael “Ozzy” Osbourne died yesterday at 76, just two weeks after playing Black Sabbath’s farewell show.

The surveillance program put CCTV cameras along Aurora Avenue North, the downtown Third Avenue corridor, and the Chinatown-International District, and integrated them with their favorite new Automated License Plate Readers into a super secret data center (it’s SPD headquarters). Barnes says they’ve assisted in 90 active criminal investigations in 60 days, but didn’t say what the investigations were (we asked and we’ll report back). Now, Harrell wants to do the same in Cal Anderson, the Capitol Hill Night Life District, and Garfield High School. What could go wrong? Serial Rapist Sentenced in Everett: Christian Sayre, a former Everett bar owner, was sentenced to 109 years for 16 counts of second-degree rape, third-degree rape of a child, indecent liberties, and possession of depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Prosecutors say Sayre used his bar in Everett as a staging ground to prey on his victims. Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said in a statement that it was “one of the most complex and disturbing cases” the department has handled. Sayre’s attorney asked that he get 17 and a half years. The prosecutors asked for 133. Judge Millie Judge (not a typo) went with 109, citing the length and breadth of Sayre’s crimes. WA Child Welfare Isn’t So Well: According to the office that oversees the Department of Children, Youth, and Families, critical injuries for kids in the state’s welfare system took a huge jump in the first half of this year. By the end of June, at least 92 children had died or nearly died, up from 78 in the first six months of 2024. Some Republicans are trying to blame the bipartisan Keep Families Together Act, but fentanyl is the likelier culprit. So far this year, 20 of the cases involving kids under 4 years old were caused by accidental fentanyl exposure. Blue Angel Blues: We’re approaching the season when literal fighter jets swoop around our city like a playground, and some Seattleites are over it. The Airshow Climate Action coalition put up a new billboard on Rainier Ave that reads: “SAY NO TO BLUE ANGELS.” Think of the rescue dogs! Think of the military trauma! Or think of the 670 tons of carbon emissions they blow through in one weekend. Crunching Some Numbers: We’re well into Primary Election Season, so we at The Stranger decided to take another look at the money Katie Wilson and Bruce Harrell have taken in. As we’ve reported before, the two are neck and neck in fundraising, but we noticed a couple key differences. First, almost $60,000 of Harrell’s donations came from outside of Seattle (the city he’d like to keep governing), compared to Wilson’s $7,207. And among his donors, 19 of them are CEOs. (The only time “chief” comes up in Katie’s donor list is a Chief Policy and Strategy Officer for the Highline School District.) I’m just gonna put this thread from Mark Ostrow here. Ok the mayor is speaking. “I embrace the wealthy.”[image or embed] A Little Brain Break: In lighter news, we sent Stranger Staff Writer Audrey Vann, a non-Katy Perry fan, to Monday’s Katy Perry concert at Climate Pledge. She learned a lot. “Before winning me over with an emotional performance of ‘Pearl,’ she had lost me with a megachurch-style sermon about her space voyage,” Vann writes. “She had long dreamed of going to space, she said, and despite her dreams being dismissed, she feels that she ultimately ‘manifested’ her trip on Blue Origin. ‘Part of me did it so that I could let go of any last bit of fear that I had, because I knew that was when my life would begin again,’ she said, tearing up. ‘And to any other girl that has a dream, you go and do it!’ This drew attention to a major discrepancy in her brand regarding female empowerment—she preaches and sings about overcoming adversity (see: ‘Roar and ‘Rise’), but the things she has overcome in her life are deeply unrelatable.” Plus, we got a new list of Katyisms out of the deal: “I’m a Scorpio, bitch!”“Is the internet real, or is this what’s real?”“I dedicate [‘I Kissed A Girl’] to the community—the ones who raised me, the ones that called me out, and the ones that educated me, and for all the little girls in between like myself.”“Love is love! It’s not a gender, it’s a frequency, so tap into it, baby!”“What’s up, Amazon family?” And if you still need a breath before we get into national and international news, spend some time in a basement with The Stranger’s Charles Mudede. Fascism Is Tacky: The administration that populates its Instagram feed with AI-generated images of eagles, money, and the DJT Jerk Off Dance just withdrew from UNESCO, the UN’s cultural agency. This is the second time in as many terms that Trump has pulled us out of the organization. In a comment to the New York Times, a State Department spokesperson accused UNESCO of promoting “divisive social and cultural causes” (Palestinians’ right to exist, mostly) and maintaining an “outsized focus on the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals, a globalist, ideological agenda” at odds “with our America First foreign policy.” Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to rename the Kennedy Center’s Opera House after Melania. No Charges for Bad Cops: You’ve probably seen the video already. Sheriff’s officers in Jacksonville, Florida, pulled William Anthony McNeil Jr. over for not having his headlights on and not wearing a seatbelt. When McNeal questioned why he was pulled over and refused to get out of the car, an officer smashed his window, punched him in the face, wrestled him out of the car, punched him again, and forced him to the ground while shouting “Stop resisting!” Prosecutors say that the officers didn’t break the law, and the Sheriff’s office is still investigating to see if any internal policies were violated. Sheriff T.K. Waters said the cellphone video doesn’t tell the full story. “Cameras can only capture what can be seen and heard,” he said at a news conference Monday. “So much context and depth are absent from recorded footage because a camera simply cannot capture what is known to the people depicted in it.” Don’t worry, T.K., it captured the racism just fine. Israel Strikes WHO Site: Israel attacked a World Health Organization’s site in central Gaza, an area that Israel has largely avoided because it believed Israeli hostages were being held there. Israel doesn’t deny raiding the facility but said any “suspects” had been treated “in accordance with international law.” Whatever the fuck that means at this point. Don’t Put That Up There: A Tokyo-based designer made a butt plug bottle with an egg-shaped, rounded bottom designed to nestle into the sand on the beach, and presented it at the 2nd International Conference on Design for Ocean Environments, which sounds very respectable. But as Mathew Rodriguez wrote for Them: “Murphy’s law tells us that what can go wrong will go wrong. Godwin’s law says that any online discussion will eventually devolve into one person comparing the other to a Nazi. To this esteemed list, let me add Gere’s law, named, of course, after the long-debunked but persistent myth that actor Richard Gere once stuck a gerbil up his butt: If it looks like someone can put it up their butt, they’ll want to.” A post shared by Kenji Abe (@kenji_abe_) Never Say Die: John Michael “Ozzy” Osbourne died yesterday at 76, just two weeks after playing Black Sabbath’s farewell show.",,"['mayor', 'election', 'police', 'SPD', 'policy', 'development']",12.0,2025-08-03T16:16:34.585993,16735

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/05/23/80070048/weve-got-a-mayors-race,The Stranger,We’ve Got a Mayor’s Race! Just Can't Get Enough?,"A new poll by the Northwest Progressive Institute (NPI) tells us what we were all hoping to hear: We have a real mayor’s race this year. NPI, our local public opinion expert, ran a poll simulating a general election throw down between the two candidates who have raised the most in their campaigns so far: Transit Riders Union General Secretary Katie Wilson (at $256,318) and Mayor Bruce Harrell (at $390,585). The top line is: in a poll of 522 likely voters, Wilson got 36 percent of the vote, Harrell got 33, and 30 percent remained undecided. I know it looks like Wilson has a solid lead, but technically, the margin of error is 4 percent, so it’s a statistical tie. But it’s a tie! With two months left in the primary, Wilson is starting to give Harrell a run for his ($390k of) money. The survey was done in two parts. First, they asked respondents to choose between Wilson and Harrell, and more than half of them (56 percent) said they weren’t sure. Harrell had the benefit of name recognition, with 25 percent, and Wilson got 18. But then NPI gave the undecided respondents another shot, providing excerpts of the candidates’ positions, and links to their campaign websites. After reviewing them, the tables turned. Among the undecideds, 34 percent said they’d vote for Wilson, 15 for Harrell, and 51 percent remained unsure. When combined, we get 36 percent for Wilson, and 33 for Harrell. Harrell was clearly more recognizable to likely voters. But NPI’s polling also asked about his job performance, and Seattle just isn’t that into Harrell at this point. Only 37 percent of the city approves of his work, and 45 percent disapproves. When respondents were asked why they said they’d vote for Wilson, 10 of them simply said, “She’s not Bruce” or “She’s not Harrell.” And Seattle has a unique relationship with incumbents. Anywhere else, being an incumbent gives you a substantial leg up. But Seattle tends to speed date our mayors. In the last 25 years, we’ve only given one mayor a second term—Greg Nickels, who only got it because he didn’t have a good challenger. This poll is very early, and the number of undecideds shows that both candidates have a lot of work to do, and it could still be anyone’s race. “This race looks like it could go in multiple directions right now and could be one of the most exciting of this local election cycle,"" said NPI founder and executive director Andrew Villeneuve in a statement. The filing deadline was only two weeks ago, and while there’s still a lot of campaigning ahead of us, the race is starting to take shape. In a city without political parties, the closest thing we have is two major donor classes: labor and business. And so far, Harrell is sweeping the field. This week, the MLK Labor council, our county’s union of unions, endorsed Harrell. So has the CEO of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, Governor Bob Ferguson, AG Nick Brown, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, among many others. But Wilson has momentum—and not just based on this poll. She qualified for the democracy voucher program in just five days, and is collecting endorsements from groups like the King County Democrats, the Transit Riders Union (duh), and progressives like former City Councilmember Tammy Morales.",,"['mayor', 'councilmember', 'election', 'mayor (title)']",10.5,2025-08-03T16:16:34.596634,3236

https://www.thestranger.com/stranger-election-control-board/2025/04/18/80019769/vote-no-on-king-county-proposition-1,The Stranger,"Vote ""No"" on King County Proposition 1 Just Can't Get Enough?","It’s time to dig through your pile of unpaid bills and Safeway coupons. We’ve got a special election coming, and your ballot’s due on Tuesday. Let's get into it. At its simplest, King County Proposition 1 is a levy renewal. It would continue funding the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), a massive biometric database that stores over 3 million fingerprint and palm print records and helps police connect prints left at crime scenes to people. It also confirms the identities of arrestees, preventing people from being wrongfully detained or released under false names. On its face, Prop 1 may seem tempting enough. This is, after all, a levy with no organized opposition (as you’ll see on your ballot), endorsed by nearly all King County Councilmembers (yep, even the ones you like), and designed to renew a decades-old program that helps solve crimes and identify the dead, sometimes those beyond recognition. It’s relatively inexpensive—about $24 a year for the average homeowner—and funds forensic infrastructure across 39 cities and unincorporated King County. There’s no question that it’s better for local police departments to share a centralized, taxpayer-funded forensic system than to duplicate these services piecemeal at additional public cost. The people who currently run AFIS do seem to take privacy concerns seriously. Additionally, the system doesn’t store citizenship data, and it complies with King County’s ban on facial recognition. As of now, AFIS doesn’t collaborate with ICE (because of the Keep Washington Working Act), doesn’t scoop up facial scans, and doesn’t seem particularly interested in expanding beyond its current scope. But what if that changes? But even reasonable-sounding systems can be dangerous when left unscrutinized. Surveillance overreach isn’t tinfoil hat anymore. It’s a Tuesday. And surveillance tools rarely stay in their lane for long. We can't afford to blindly renew government tracking tools—no matter how routine—without first demanding detailed accountability, privacy protections, and public oversight. We asked Tee Sannon, the Technology Policy Program Director at the ACLU of Washington, and she flagged serious concerns about AFIS—from its potential for abuse to the lack of public transparency around how the system actually works. While the ACLU hasn’t taken an official stance on Prop 1 (they didn’t last time either), Sannon made it clear that questions about how this biometric data is managed, and what might happen to it down the line—are more urgent than ever in today’s political climate. Could this data be repurposed later? Used in ways the public never agreed to? That uncertainty alone should give us pause. AFIS is a surveillance system, and like all surveillance systems, it lives inside a criminal legal infrastructure with a long and ongoing track record of racism, data misuse, and mission creep. And right now, this system operates with little meaningful public oversight, and just as little transparency about how it impacts the communities most likely to be swept up in it. Back in 2018, we told voters to reject the AFIS levy because it came bundled with facial recognition software, tech we didn’t want then and still don’t trust now. To their credit, the county banned facial recognition in 2021, and AFIS officials say the software has been disabled. But pay special attention to that word: disabled, not deleted. Not dismantled. We shouldn’t expect the erosion of civil liberties to creep at a snail's place. Change is coming at the speed and volume of an avalanche. The federal government is hoarding surveillance powers and conducting warrantless data grabs. It’s proudly throwing immigrants like Kilmar Ábrego García in foreign prisons they may never escape. And the ICE snatch job on Rumeysa Ozturk, taken into an unmarked van by plainclothes federal agents, looked awfully like a secret police operation. Our civil liberties aren’t being chipped away at, they’re being jackhammered. So forgive us if we’re slightly suspicious of any system that collects biometric data on hundreds of thousands of people, promises it’s “just for fingerprints,” and asks us to trust that it will never, ever be used for anything nefarious. This time around, Prop 1 supporters say there’s nothing to worry about. No facial recognition. No new biometrics. No big expansion. Just a routine renewal. Just trust us. We’d be skeptical of that any day, but today? Today the federal government is pulling every lever it can find to surveil the population and amass information that can support its agenda of mass deportations—and that’s just what’s happening three months into the administration. Prop 1 allows data collected by AFIS to be shared with state and federal agencies—including the FBI—without any clear, enforceable restrictions. Once that data leaves King County’s hands, the Keep Washington Working Act (which keeps Washington law enforcement from participating in immigration enforcement) doesn’t protect our state’s immigrants. The data AFIS collects can be repurposed for uses that are opaque to the public and often hostile to civil liberties. Worse, the public has no real way to see how the system is being used. AFIS doesn’t publish regular audits or racial breakdowns of whose prints are in the system. There are no citizen oversight bodies empowered to review its operations. There are no requirements for public disclosure when policies change or technologies expand. AFIS is a biometric dragnet in an era when rights are increasingly fragile, and when the difference between “not used for this” and “can’t legally be used for this” matters more than ever. Supporters of Prop 1 argue that rejecting this levy will delay investigations, hurt cold case resolution, and force local departments to pay more for worse systems. That might be true. But that’s an indictment of how little effort has been made to rebuild AFIS into something accountable and transparent, not a reason to keep funding it without conditions. Voting no on Prop 1 is a vote demanding more from a system that has quietly amassed the biometric data of millions of people and is asking for our continued trust with almost no strings attached. We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: Surveillance systems don’t get safer when we stop paying attention. They expand when we’re distracted. They deepen when we stop asking questions. And eventually, predictably, they turn toward us. We’re in a crisis of government, morality, and sanity right now. Anything that helps authoritarianism is worth saying no to, and finding new ways to make it work. We urge you to vote “No” on King County Proposition No 1.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/06/30/80124841/dems-mamdani-is-not-extreme,The Stranger,"Dems, Mamdani Is Not Extreme Just Can't Get Enough?","At this point, we must conclude that the principal function of ICE isn’t the enforcement of immigration laws, but the occupation and policing of cities. “[We] must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America’s largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside,” Trump posted on TruthSocial, not long after the rain fell, in every way, on his June 14 military parade, and, more significantly, while millions of Americans protested his brazen “will to [authoritarian] power.” Trump then described “Radical Left Democrats” as “sick in the mind,” unpatriotic, and so on and so forth. And then Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic primary in New York City on Tuesday, June 24. He is an immigrant, a socialist, and a Muslim. He is the embodiment of all that is considered wicked in our hyper-MAGA times. The message issued from this stunning victory against America's increasingly and frustratingly milquetoast center-left—a center-left whose leading strategy for Trump’s authoritarianism is to do nothing and let it somehow burn out on its own—is that something must be done. Our values, which are under attack, must be asserted, even if that means imprisonment. It is illegal to kidnap brown (or any kind of) people from the streets or our cities. The US is, and has always been, a multicultural society. This assertion is at the heart of the protests on the streets of LA and the ballots in NYC. But first, we must understand the core of the developments that led us to where we are now. The line in Trump’s June 14 post that requires our attention is found here: “[City people] believe in Open Borders, Transgender for Everybody, and Men playing in Women’s sports.” When you identify cosmopolitan values with lawbreaking, then those values are, in this interpretation, criminal. And so you have crime in the streets, and crime in Pride parades, and crime even in City Hall. On Tuesday, June 17, Brad Lander—New York City’s comptroller, a progressive, and a candidate in the recent NYC primary that saw Andrew Cuomo and the Dems’ conservatives go down in flames—was manhandled and arrested by ICE thugs for doing his job in a court of law. Before that, the thugs did pretty much the same thing to a California senator for legally participating in a Homeland Security press conference. And before that, it was the mayor of Newark, who, again, was doing nothing more than following the law. The appearance of ICE in blue states—blue because they are dominated by their urban centers—doesn’t explain, of course, the essence of this appearance, which has its source in the GOP’s long and steady project of repressing the Black vote. With ICE, voter repression leaves the judiciary apparatus and enters the US’s repressive apparatus, which includes the conventional police (by means of compliance), immigration enforcement, and the army, as demonstrated by the National Guard’s current and ever-expanding occupation of Los Angeles. This occupation, which will eventually expand to all major metropolitan areas, has as its mission the enervation of the blue voters. Why? The GOP, which first lost command of the white vote in cities and, gradually, the suburbs, is in actuality the minority party. Without certain institutional (and therefore structural) advantages, the country should have long accepted the obvious fact of its multiculturalness and been organized by a politics that spanned from the likes of Joe Biden (conservative) to the likes of Mamdani (progressive). Trump would be unelectable if our national democracy were as robustly representative as in states such as California, New York, and, of course, Washington. The urban values supported by the Democratic Party should be regarded as conventional, as the usual, as the everyday. What must be registered as bizarre is not Mamdani, but Stephen Miller. The former actually represents, like the current composition of the Supreme Court, a small segment of America, but is, instead, the expression of a larger political structure that artificially amplifies his voice and views. If the left does not grasp the fact that what is at stake is our lopsided democracy, then we will continue fighting against apparitions (“more should be done to attract MAGA voters,” “Mamdani is a radical,” and so on), but not the real stuff of American life. During his first term in office, Trump continued the GOP’s repression of the Black vote but left urban white voters, who over the past 30 years moved from the graveyard of the right to the spectrum on the left, unbothered. Not so with his second term. He is going after them with the hope of grinding what’s left of American democracy into the dust. This is where ICE comes into the picture. It’s not really about brown people (who, nevertheless, pay the traumatic price of ICE’s brazen lawbreaking); it’s about the white voters who, through urban processes, became liberated not so much from racism (we still have lots of that, even in progressive Seattle) but from the hot, anti-immigrant stuff of Trump’s rallies. Stephen Miller Invokes Racist Conspiracy Theory To Dismiss Mamdani newrepublic.com/post/197219/...[image or embed] And so, this is where things presently stand, Seattle. Los Angeles is coming our way, and it will definitely be a time of trouble, a time when our values are bombarded daily, when America’s white nationalist minority oppresses its multicultural majority. So, how are we going to come? Let’s turn to New York City for an answer.",,"['mayor', 'candidate', 'police']",8.0,2025-08-03T16:16:34.590636,5535
https://www.thestranger.com/stranger-election-control-board/2025/07/03/80127888/vote-for-erika-evans-for-city-attorney,The Stranger,Vote for Erika Evans for City Attorney Just Can't Get Enough?,"In case you’ve been living under a rock for the last three-and-a-half years, let us brief you on our current City Attorney: the regrettable Republican Ann Davison. The City Attorney has two jobs: one criminal (prosecuting all of the city’s misdemeanor cases, like DUIs and domestic violence charges) and one civil (acting as the city’s attorney, either suing people or other governments and also defending Seattle in court when, for instance, the Seattle Chamber of Commerce sues the city to kill the JumpStart tax). From a criminal perspective, Davison’s whole thing is being “tough on crime,” which famously does nothing to make our city safer or to get people on the streets the help they need. She instituted policies like Close-in-Time filing. Implemented in 2022, it’s meant to reduce the criminal case backlog, but really just places the backlog in a different pile. It hasn’t worked. Her “High Utilizer Initiative” to target frequent offenders, surprise, also doesn’t solve any problems and worsens recidivism. Plus, Davison killed “community court,” an alternative system that offers people charged with misdemeanors non-punitive options to resolve their cases. Meanwhile, Davison is unforgivably behind on filing DUI cases—one of the two serious misdemeanors the office can prosecute. Domestic violence cases are lagging. Back in 2021, before Davison, it took 26 days to file a DV case. Last year, on average, it took twice as long. Davison is a tumor on the city and we don’t expect her to be willing to stand up to Trump. She converted to the Republican party during DJT’s first term, when anyone with an ounce of sense jumped ship. When King County, San Francisco, Santa Clara County, Portland, and New Haven signed onto a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security for their attacks on “sanctuary jurisdictions,” Davison dragged her feet, only joining the lawsuit months later. Meanwhile, while Boston and 43 other cities (including our less progressive neighbors, Spokane and Olympia) fought cuts to federal research funding, Davison stayed out of it. This person cannot protect us from the next three-and-a-half years (or more) of authoritarian encroachment. So, she sucks. We can’t let her win again. And she could. With three progressive challengers splitting the left vote, Davison will almost certainly skate through the primary, liberal Seattle bubble be damned. The people who didn’t march in the No Kings rally get ballots, too! Of this bunch, we believe Erika Evans, a former assistant US Attorney, is our choice to best Ann, make the City Attorney’s office effective and fair, and protect Seattle from the Trump administration. Evans has prosecuted hate crimes, she’s gone after drug traffickers, she’s slapped the wrists of business owners dipping into their employees’ wages, and she was involved in a case prosecuting January 6ers from Puyallup. Her résumé is impressive. Her platform (speed up DUI and DV case filings, bring back community court, prosecute wage theft, improve the police union contract to allow for more policing alternatives) mirrors the platforms of her opponents. But they don’t have her grit. In our meeting, Evans leapt for her opponents’ throats. She presented exhibits for every argument, and demonstrated a deep understanding of the power, and limitations, of the City Attorney’s Office. She spoke thoughtfully about the importance of working closely with Washington Attorney General Nick Brown against the constitutionally intolerant Trump administration, and made a commitment to not prosecute “peaceful” protesters (though she wouldn’t define a “peaceful protester” for us, which is peak prosecutor brain). We also love a prop comedian: she brought Jarritos and African Black soap to symbolize SOAP/SODA laws, a Raggedy Ann doll to represent Davison, a printout of photos of the white men who have held this office for the 150 years before Ann got the job, a binder of her and her opponents case files. Sure, she gave Model-UN vibes, and if being corny were illegal this woman would be in jail. But it isn’t. And what we care about is Evans’s ability and will to protect us when Trump goes after this city. We know, we know. A history as a prosecutor brings with it a track record of upholding a system built for oppression. But our federal government is actively antagonistic to cities like ours, and a prosecutor knows how the federal government works. Evans knows what levers to pull. And local progressives such as City Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck and State Rep. Shaun Scott believe she’s the right choice despite all the prosecutorial baggage. But we don’t discount her mistakes and our misgivings. Evans voted for Bruce Harrell last election (“But I voted for Nikkita Oliver twice when they ran,” Evans said). She donated $100 to Harrell’s campaign before Katie Wilson got into the race, but wouldn’t say whom she was voting for in this election, and hedged by saying she couldn’t talk shit when the winner could be her client. Public defenders are worried about what her real intentions are and how she’ll act when she’s in the seat of power. We understand where they’re coming from. But we’re inviting her to prove them wrong. This wasn’t an easy decision. Any of Davison’s challengers would be wildly better for Seattle. We wish we could have endorsed Nathan Rouse, the public defender running for the seat, because he knows the system doesn’t work for everyday people and wants to change it. He’s tougher on the Seattle Police Officers Guild than any other candidates. But he didn’t convince us he could put his ideas into action or win. Please run again next time, Nathan. We want to see you in our swivel chairs again, with more experience under your belt. Thanks for the Pop-Tarts. And Rory O’Sullivan could do a perfectly fine job in the role. But he lacks trial experience. And most importantly, we aren’t confident he could beat Davison. Evans will hit the ground running in a way we need. Here’s to knocking Davison into the stratosphere. Vote Evans.",,"['councilmember', 'election', 'police']",8.0,2025-08-03T16:16:34.590636,6041

Referrals to Restorative Community Pathways (RCP) are on pause for some juveniles until the prosecuting attorney's office says it sees better results. RELATED | 16-year-old charged as adult in Shoreline shooting that killed 1, injured another It was last year that Jaden Taylor, 16, was charged as an adult in the murder of a Shoreline woman. As KOMO has reported, court documents state that before this tragedy, Taylor had a referral on his juvenile record for allegedly brandishing a weapon at school. The documents allege he was sent to RCP, but he never went. ""[We] see people [in the program] who come back and are accused of really terrible crimes. We want to see that number as low as possible,"" Casey McNerthney of the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office (KCPAO) stated about the diversion program. That same program is meant to keep people ages 17 and younger charged with a first-time felony or misdemeanor from reoffending by connecting them with various community services. The program is back in the spotlight after the prosecutor’s office looked into its success rate, and after a King County councilmember's call for a program audit. LEARN MORE | King County council member seeks audit of youth diversion program after murder case The KCPAO confirms prosecutors will stop juvenile felony diversions, which are non-violent crimes, to the RCP, for now. Juvenile misdemeanor cases are still being referred to the program. ""What we want, and what I think everyone in King County wants, is a transparent program that’s really cost-effective, that shows results of people across the board- and regardless of your political leaning, people look at and say, ‘Yeah, that makes sense to me,'"" McNerthney told KOMO News. Prosecutor Leesa Manion, in a memo, told King County councilmembers the recidivism rate over the past two years was 53%, meaning more than half of the juveniles accused of non-violent felonies in the program were more likely than not to commit another crime. Seattle University Economics Professor Claus Portner analyzed the data for prosecutors and is working on a second analysis he expects to be complete in a few months. A representative with the RCP in a statement argues the sample size used to collect the data is too small to make an analysis, and that the program is a vital initiative that is working. Spokesperson Jasmine Vail adds: ""The support we offer to harmed parties, and the safety and healing we build with young people, isn’t just a smart investment—it’s a pathway to true public safety. These are the lives of young people in our community. We cannot afford to reduce them to flawed numbers."" A Juvenile Detention for Washington State report shows it costs $34,039 annually or $588 per day to house a young person in Washington, whereas community-based programs cost about $75 per day. In late July, Council Member and Budget Chair Rod Dembowski said he does not want the diversion program to be funded through a newly passed Public Safety Sales Tax, despite there being no spending plan. ""I've run amendments to cut the funding for it,"" Dembowski said. ""The prosecutor, frustratingly, has supported that program for years, so I'm glad that she's joined those of us who have had concerns about it."" Manion in the memo noted the county must preserve juvenile diversion as a viable option for case referrals, and that the prosecuting attorney's office ""is committed to working with all King County leaders to continue to build and improve diversion to benefit all our communities."" ""What you’ve got to have is a diversion model that people will agree on, that is transparent and cost-effective and is clearly working,"" McNerthney added. King County’s Department of Human Services holds the contracts for the RCP. The agency did not respond to KOMO's multiple requests for comment about concerns over the diversion program.",,"['councilmember', 'budget', 'public safety']",7.0,2025-08-03T16:17:45.694834,4147
https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/03/07/79956893/city-hall-is-back-on-denny-blaine,The Stranger,City Hall Is Back on Denny Blaine Just Can't Get Enough?,"After trying and failing to erect a playground at Denny Blaine Park, the queer, nude beach on Lake Washington, the millionaire owner of University Village and his wealthy neighbors want a city Park Ranger stopping by to to keep watch for public pee-ers and masturbators at the beach, much to the frustration of the park’s queer-led stewardship group. The move has kicked up a two-year fight between beachgoers and its neighbors—the former to protect a historically queer space, and the latter to exert some control over it. To recap, Stuart Sloan, the aforementioned millionaire, lives next to Denny Blaine Park, which has been a queer, nude beach for at least four decades. Tired of the naked people outside his mansion, Sloan donated $1 million to the city in 2023 to build a children’s playground at Denny Blaine. To ease his plan along, Sloan appeared to leverage his connection with Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell, whose office staff, and staff at the Seattle Parks Department, met with Sloan to update him on its progress. Harrell has denied knowing the identity of the donor, despite the two meeting the day after the city killed the playground and Sloan texting Harrell’s personal cell phone in March 2023 to complain of the “DISGUSTING” nudity at the beach, complete with photos of naked people, whose butts and penises Sloan took the “liberty” of digitally scribbling out. For modesty. (A spokesperson for Sloan previously told The Stranger the only concern was illegal activity, but the photos did not show it and the exchange did not mention it). When Sloan’s plan went public, the gay community saw it for the deterrent it was, and organized, pushing the city to dump the plan and save the summer. Last Spring, neighbors and the activists, who’d by that time formed the Seattle Parks Foundation affiliated Friends of Denny Blaine Park, tried to hash out a solution that would make everyone happy, but those conversations didn’t go anywhere. Neighbors, who formed their own group, Denny Blaine Park for All, took their grievances to Hollingsworth, who said on a recent episode of the podcast Seattle Nice that neighbors thought peeing and masturbation were out of control. Denny Blaine Park for All did not respond to a request for comment. “A small group, I’d say about 10 percent of folks, who go down there and there’s inappropriate behavior,” she said. “Masturbation. Indecent exposure. Relieving themselves in the bushes or in the lake.” If 10 percent of people at Denny Blaine were masturbating and pissing everywhere, it would be an empty, sticky, stinky beach, not a desirable summer spot. Hollingsworth clarified she hadn't promised neighbors a Park Ranger, and conceded the number was just a guess–it could as easily be 0.5 percent–to convey how few people were doing that, and that they were coming from outside the community. To be sure, masturbation happens. When Friends of Denny Blaine Park, the stewardship group that grew from the activist movement to fight the playground, surveyed 58 beachgoers, half said they’d seen masturbation at least once. Most said they had not been sexually harassed at the beach, but those who did had dealt with inappropriate sexual comments, intense staring, and run of the mill creeps pestering them while they sunbathed. But the overwhelming consensus from park goers is that they want the community to handle these incidents, not the city, says Colleen Kimseylove, who co-runs Friends of Denny Blaine. Kimseylove has planned a series of intervention trainings for this summer meant to help people handle the occasional weirdo. Kimseylove thinks the root of that behavior lies in people thinking they’re getting away with something, or that nudity is a secret act. Equipping people with skills to interrupt this behavior keeps the beach a “dignified, safe place for all,” but installing a park ranger, to act as city hall monitor, seemed a step too close to surveillance. “If the concern is inappropriate public behavior, a park ranger is not in the best position to be able to discern that,” Kimseylove said. “Naked public people know naked public behavior best. They’re in the best position to be able to interpret when this has gone from a lonely clueless guy trying to start up conversations with people on the beach to a lonely clueless guy following people around the beach, after they’ve moved themselves around again and again.” Hollingsworth says she understood that privacy concern. “Ideally, what I’d like to see happen is for it to continue to be used how it is, with the gay community,” she said. “Longterm, I would love to see the neighbors join Friends of Denny Blaine; I would love for everyone to come together and work out their issues.” Neighbors had also asked Hollingsworth for additional porta potties, more frequent trash pick up, and to stop people from parking in front of their driveways. On that, they’re mostly aligned with Friends of Denny Blaine. They have been asking the city for additional trash canisters and porta potties for more than a year. Permanent improvements paid for with city money from the Parks Department’s CommUNITY fund, including a study for bathrooms, and accessible stairs are already in the works, says Sophie Amity Debs, who runs the Friends group with Kimseylove. Amity Debs noted Hollingsworth’s appearance at the public meeting in December 2023 that killed the playground plan, where she told the community she’d look into the issue when she took office. “To hear that she seemingly hasn’t been taking action, or meeting with us, and is meeting with Sloan, it doesn’t shock me, but it is disappointing,” Amity Debs said. Hollingsworth says the neighbors initiated the conversations and she’s willing to meet with anyone. Bruce Harrell’s office says the Park Ranger program is meant to reduce the reliance on police, citing 725 incidents it says rangers deescalated last year. Though, when Rangers can’t deescalate a situation, they do call the cops, Parks said. The Mayor’s office did not say if it supported the idea, or why the reduction in parking was a city priority, but acknowledged a “diverse range of opinions” about the beach. The office says the city’s goal is to build trust with park goers through “friendly faces,” which it understood would take time. Parks would listen to park users to “determine appropriate deployment usage,” Mayor Harrell’s office says. Even so, a friendly face may not seem so friendly if it works for the city and you’re naked. . Kimseylove says the group has a public email. If Sloan or neighbors want to work with people who know the “shape of the issue,” they’re not hard to find, they said.",,"['mayor', 'police', 'parks']",6.0,2025-08-03T16:16:34.589530,6647

Written exclusively by Black Portlanders, the purpose of BlackOut is to remember and reflect on the May 25, 2020 murder of George Floyd at the hands of police, and the 100+ days of protests in Portland that same year.

You can read all the BlackOut articles here.] ""First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says ‘I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;’ who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ‘more convenient season.’ Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection."" -Martin Luther King, “Letter from A Birmingham Jail,” 1963 I’m going to be honest: I’ve always been skeptical about the term ""Black Lives Matter."" Not the intention behind it, but the phrasing. With all due respect to Alicia Garza and Patrisse Cullors, the Black women who gave birth to this term, it has always felt like a rallying cry of “Water is Wet!” or “The Stove is Hot!” or even “Make America Pay Reparations!”—oh wait. “Of course my fucking life matters,” I’ve always thought. No matter what outside forces try to convince the masses, melanin is magic, majestic, ordinary, and ornery. I don’t subscribe to the idea that Black lives are less valuable. We matter. I know it. But for over a decade, this phrase has served as the go-to banner for a movement pushing for our lives to exist fully, without threats, barriers, and degradation. It’s with this knowledge I must acknowledge that every movement transforms, after all. From “I Am a Man” to “Black Lives Matter.” From “In God We Trust” to “Make America Great Again.” On June 5, 2020, the city of Washington, DC, commissioned a mural stretching two city blocks with the simple phrase “BLACK LIVES MATTER” in bold yellow letters. This street painting, located just three minutes from the White House, emerged amid the national outrage sparked by George Floyd’s brutal murder by police less than two weeks earlier. The streets were on fire—some precincts literally were. The pandemic had just forced millions to witness the horror of a man being killed while his brothers in blue stood by. The dots were starting to connect for some: Maybe this wasn’t just a series of isolated incidents. Maybe this was part of a much larger problem. The mural, which became known as Black Lives Matter Plaza, was symbolic. And contrary to the sentiments of some, symbolic gestures do indeed matter. For example, a swastika tells me a lot about a place or person in a very short amount of time. Coincidentally, so do American flags—but that’s another conversation. That line might offend my political connects. But I digress. Black Lives Matter Plaza became a form of protest, but also validation. And while “Black Lives Matter” isn’t my preferred rallying cry, I have to admit it felt good to see it carved out in the concrete. Key word: “felt”—past tense. At the time of writing this, the Trump administration and his allies in Congress began dismantling the mural. The process of destroying it is expected to take between six and eight weeks. They say the mural will be replaced with “more inclusive” works. Republicans are even working on renaming the area, “Liberty Plaza.” Symbols matter. 2020 marked a time when some began reevaluating the symbols that color, and in many ways direct, our lives. Some learned that the Confederacy wasn’t the only entity responsible for enslaving people; presidents of the Union were too. Some learned that slavery wasn’t just a moral issue—it was deeply economic, the backbone of this nation’s growth. Some learned that modern police departments in America evolved from “slave patrols,” whose primary task was capturing runaway enslaved people, who were considered above all, property. As the layers of history were peeled back, many of the symbols around us began to look more like scars than stars. And so the monuments started to fall. Hundreds of statues were dethroned, not by a vote, but by wrath. In my hometown of Portland, Oregon, symbols came tumbling down faster than shit in the Willamette River on a rainy day in the 90’s. George Washington fell. Thomas Jefferson was toppled in front of the once majority Black high school named after him. The 19th century co-owner and publisher of The Oregonian, Harvey Scott, felt the weight of gravity too; replaced by a bronze bust of York—the Black man who helped lead the Oregon Trail alongside Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, only to be returned to slavery at the end of the expedition. (York’s bust was later toppled too.) Grappling with this growing phenomenon of fallen statues, I wrote an article for Street Roots around this time titled “Racist Slurs Permeate Oregon Geography,” in which I detailed how an alarming number of rivers, streams, mountains, and more across my state were originally named after anti-Black slurs like Nigger Ben Mountain and Nigger Brown Canyon – some of which have been renamed since. The point was clear: in order to topple racism, we must do so at both the head and root, for it is in fact embedded throughout the soil of this stolen land. George Floyd, like Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and so many others, are now symbols—a stand-in for any Black life. We understood that what happened to them could happen to any of us at any time in this country. Because it does all the time. Sudden death. Slow death. The system loves to kill, and then throw up a shrine to your murderers. The Burnside Bridge in Portland is one of the many connecting points across the Willamette River, helping the city earn its nickname “Bridgetown.” Named after a white businessman active during the late 1800s, the drawbridge is one of a dozen that have been built across the river since the city was established some 17 decades ago. The bridge is one of the most accessible, whether by bus, car, bike, or foot. It connects the Eastside to downtown Portland, with the iconic Portland sign—featuring a flying deer whose nose glows red at Christmas—marking the entrance. There’s a story about the Ku Klux Klan’s involvement in the bridge’s construction. I don’t have enough ink space for that tangent right now—but do your Googles if you're curious. For me though, the Burnside Bridge had always been little more than a channel from point A to point B. But on June 2, 2020, it became the center of the universe. On that day, thousands of people gathered on the bridge. Estimates say more than 10,000 souls flooded the Burnside. I never watched the video of George Floyd’s final moments. I’d seen enough clips of state violence to know the horror, and I didn’t feel the need to bear witness to his murder either. While I’ve grown tired of these videos, I understand that the social media era I grew up in helped birth the Black Lives Matter movement and other adjacent organizing in my generation. Videos of the dark sides of our lives can go viral at any time, and now oftentimes do. But this time was particularly extraordinary. It was 17-year-old Darnella Frazier’s recording of George Floyd’s murder that gave the world a front row seat to his particularly cruel last moments. It was the existence of her video of his execution, paired with the hollowness of a pandemic that propelled so many millions around the globe to say his name; and thus ours. But for me, I did not need to see to know. I watched the livestream as 10,000 souls stood silently, face down with hands behind their backs for 9 minutes—the exact length of time Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into George Floyd’s neck. And for a moment, watching this scene, I thought maybe, just maybe, a change might come. I was living in an apartment in Old Town at the time, just blocks from where the scene was unfurling. I didn’t feel compelled to add my body to the mass that day. Not for any one reason, but for that moment, I felt like I was right there. I was proud. Dare I say, I was starting to feel some hope. The protests that followed George Floyd’s death were the largest in U.S. history. They weren’t confined to cities—they spread to suburbs, rural areas, and eventually to the world. From Portland to Poland, people joined the movement for Black lives, creating millions of new co-conspirators from all backgrounds. For a while, I wondered if the world was finally catching up to the way we’ve been catching hell. Could it be that America was beginning to “get it”? But 100+ days later, the protests gave way to distraction. Infighting, fatigue, and the usual tactics used by three letter agencies to dismantle Black liberation movements began to crystallize their grip. My pessimism was reignited. It’s not that the protests didn’t accomplish anything—they did. To suggest otherwise gives over-inflated credit to white mediocrity. We marched and learned. We shared stories and space. We cried, we gave. We pushed back. We reclaimed shit that’s been ours. That perfect storm, we rode it ‘til the wheels fell off. It’s 2025 now, and the storm has indeed passed. But the reality hasn’t. When would another moment like this come again? One where a viral pandemic sat the entire world down for months to show us our collective frailty? One where that same pandemic is paired with the death of a Black man in such a horrific way, that it compels millions to risk their health and very bodies in the midst of a global emergency, because finally we collectively understood that the emergency for Black people had been viral long before COVID-19. It won’t. It won’t ever happen again. IT WON’T! However, Black people will continue to die. In the five years since George Floyd, many more have, whether directly at the hands of the state or more covertly through systemic forces. Despite this, Black resistance persists. From Pan-Africans to the Panthers, the Urban League to the NAACP, seasoned activists to the next baton-carriers birthed out this leg of the Black Lives Matter movement; resistance remains varied but persistent. I too, persist. I wake up every day and do what I do; I protest. I write. I organize. I make art. I connect. I strategize. I tell the stories of our greatness. I raise two little girls to be conscious of the world they’re coming up in, giving them the a little bit more truth with every milestone, so that they do in fact understand that water is wet, the stove is hot, and that America should pay reparations. But I cannot yet tell them what world they will inherit. One of the most striking quotes from Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is, “the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice.” I first heard these words, revived by Rev. Dr. Leroy Haynes Jr., while covering a rally against police violence across the street from Portland City Hall as a reporter more than a decade ago. They always stuck with me. The older I get now though— especially since 2020—I fear those words were just pretty prose. The words King subsequently spoke towards the closing chapter of his life resonate more strongly these days: “I fear I may have integrated my people into a burning house.” Quote that at your next MLK Day get-together. As the common symbol of the Civil Rights movement and the de-facto figurehead for American progress, King’s words now feel more relevant than ever. Liberals love to blame Trump and the Republicans for the flames, but there are plenty on the other “side” who have forgotten the Burnside Bridge. There are many who have since seen the Burnside Bridge in 2020 and decided it would make for good art, a nice social media post, and “powerful” conversation, but continuous action was a step or two too far today. For many it seems George Floyd’s face is more like a Nirvana t-shirt today. The system is flawed, but not that bad. That’s the problem with symbols. Symbols should inspire, but they shouldn’t and can never replace action. The erasure of Black Lives Matter Plaza in D.C. doesn’t stop the work I do, but it is a reminder of the times we’re in. It's a reminder of how quickly some have sprinted from 2020, into “moderation.” A reminder that like unapologetically progressive (and absurdly accomplished) Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty’s replacement by law-and-order conservative Rene Gonzalez (who was mostly absurd) on Portland City Council; Just like Oregon Democrats and Republicans teaming up to roll back Measure 110 and recriminalize addiction; Just like Intisar Abioto raising a million dollars to reclaim the house of the Portland NAACP founder only to be undercut by a White Realtor and White buyers, And like the 2020 protests being reduced into “discourse” of “riots” that we must “clean up” after—America is back to its regularly scheduled programming. And the fire is burning. Five years later, George Floyd is no longer just a man. He’s a symbol—a reminder of America’s blood on the roots, and the leaves. I know what I see when I see George Floyd. What about you? Five years later, it feels like it did six years ago. Five years later, we’ve returned to “normal.” And now, perhaps, the fire is burning hotter than ever. So, when I’m gray-haired (God willing), driving across the Burnside Bridge with Black Lives Matter fading in the rearview, I wonder: Will I be crossing into the ashes or a new beginning? Only time will tell. Maybe all that “care” was just… symbolic. Donovan Scribes is an award-winning writer, producer, and owner of the communications consulting firm D Scribes LLC.

One group walked into the main entrance. Another group trotted down the stairs leading to the ground floor entrance. More went around the back. Vans and cars pulled up on E Stevens Way NE, stopped momentarily, and deposited more people and supplies such as bisected garbage cans-turned-shield and large metal sheets. Inside the 700,000-square-foot building’s glass walls, the new arrivals asked students and faculty to leave because they were taking over the building. As they left, informational flyers in hand, the protesters began to chain the IEB’s doors shut. The IEB cost UW $102 million. Ten million of that came from Boeing. For a century, Boeing has been one of UW’s top donors and the top employer of school alumni. In an April 2022 collaboration proposal between UW and Boeing, UW says that they will “work in close partnership with subject experts at Boeing to make sure the curriculum and research topics are highly relevant for top-priority challenges within the company.” And since 1948, Boeing has also been a key arms supplier to the Israel Defense Forces. The university’s relationship with Boeing is why these people had come to the IEB. For several hours on Monday, protesters affiliated with the Students United for Palestinian Equality and Return (SUPER) UW took over the IEB. They hung a sign renaming it the Sha’ban al-Dalou Building, honoring a Palestinian teenager slain by Israeli forces. In a press release, SUPER UW said they were “responding to the call” of the student movement in Gaza following the October 7 attacks in Israel, celebrating the way it “shattered the illusion of zionist-imperialist domination and brought Palestine to the forefront for all justice-loving people of the world.”“Our brothers and sisters in Gaza are living under a sky of constant US-funded rocket fire, while the zionist regime is continuing its land thefts and the torture and imprisonment of over 10,000 Palestinians who are facing lengthy sentences and unspeakable abuse,” the press release read. “Meanwhile, American and western institutions, like UW, continue to fund these atrocities and attempt to demonize the just struggle of the Palestinian people.” UW reported the protesters caused $1 million in damages, saying protesters spray painted messages like “Boeing Kills” on the walls, ripped a classroom door off its hinges, sealed doorways with epoxy glue, and smashed the glass doors housing specialized machinery that cost upwards of $100,000 a piece. (When reached for comment, Noah Weight, a student in SUPER UW, didn’t comment on the reported damage. Instead, he pointed to the group's mission. “Every single university [in Gaza] has been reduced to rubble,” Weight wrote, “but Western journalists, academics, and the public seem more concerned with damage done here, to a building that is intended to expand the scale of that destruction,” Weight wrote.) Late into Monday night, police in riot gear gathered. They faced off with protesters, and together with University of Washington Police, the Seattle Police Department arrested 32 protesters on Monday night for criminal trespass in the first degree, a misdemeanor. This marked the first significant pro-Palestine on-campus demonstration since Donald Trump took office and began targeting, detaining, and deporting international students involved in last spring’s protest encampments. Thanks to this administration, the landscape for protesting in general, and especially protesting against the war in Gaza, has changed. And our local responses show diverging paths: those who parrot the Trump administration’s propaganda, and those who resist it. This morning, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown released a statement about the damage to the school. He called the protest “disturbing,” and said that “it is clear that there was substantial damage to public property and threats to the overall safety of the university community.” He continued: “I am thankful that those responsible were arrested and, if found guilty, should be held accountable. I fully and always support people’s right to protest and to express their views. Indeed it is foundational to our democracy. But everyone has a right to be safe on campus and UW must enforce the law.” This is the kind of standard law and order statement you can expect from the powers that be when protests go down—especially when there's property damage in the mix. The university struck a different tone. After Monday’s building occupation, UW President Ana Mari Cauce sent an email to the UW community where she condemned the protest and said the university would “continue our actions to oppose antisemitism, racism and all forms of biases.” The official UW statement on the matter from UW spokesperson Victor Balta called the protest an “antisemitic statement” and said UW “will not be intimidated by this sort of offensive and destructive behavior and will continue to oppose antisemitism in all its forms.” Yesterday, in a press release, Trump’s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, a collaboration of some of the biggest idiots in our government (an Avengers assembly from hell of the Department of Education, Department of Health, and General Services Administration) weighed in on the situation, using their same tired rhetoric. U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon called the protest “yet another horrifying display of the antisemitic harassment and lawlessness which has characterized many of our nation’s elite campuses over the last several years,” and said it disrupted the lives of “Jewish students who live in fear on campus, of their equal opportunity protections and civil rights.” But the administration had a surprise for UW. Seattle is generally the Big Bad Radical Left in the Trump administration’s commentary, but yesterday, they broke that streak. The task force specifically commended UW’s “strong statement condemning [Monday] night’s violence.” Under a Trump administration that is already withholding research grant money, threatening funding over diversity and inclusion policies, and directly attacking universities like Harvard and Columbia, where prominent protests were held, the tenor of the University of Washington’s reaction to these protests has shifted. Echoing Trump administration talking points, faculty and administrators lambasted Monday’s demonstration as antisemitic. Last spring, when a pro-Palestine tent encampment sprung up in UW’s quad, UW’s tone was different. For three weeks, students and non-students gathered and refused to leave until the university cut ties with Israel and Boeing. It ended after UW agreed to increase transparency about its financial holdings and provide scholarships for displaced Palestinian students among other things. In her statement regarding the encampments, Cauce only referenced “vile rhetoric.” Now, “vile rhetoric” has become clear, actionable “antisemitism.” Alex Stonehill, the associate director of communication leadership at UW, rebuked the claims of antisemitism in these protests. “[Universities] are supposed to be these bastions of critical thought and critical inquiry about what’s happening,” Stonehill said. “When we see pretty baseless accusations of antisemitism on campus and when we don’t interrogate that and push back against it and try to figure out what’s actually happening, we’ve given up. It’s important to take a stand.” Student protesters such as Eric Horford believe in their movement, regardless of the higher stakes under the current administration. “We know the Trump administration is incredibly repressive,” Horford said. “But ultimately, regardless of whether it was Trump or Biden and Harris in office, the federal government has been incredibly anti-Palestinian and anti-student movement. The repression is always strong, and that's why we remain optimistic that no matter who we're up against, that our movement can stay strong and grow.” “We are demanding that Boeing and the influence of other companies that profit off of war be removed from our educational spaces here at UW,” Horford said. “We think it is shameful that after the developments of last year, they would continue and finish the construction of a building that's been invested in by Boeing.” But the situation is different for UW these days. They may not be as willing to appease protesters when they are busy appeasing a dictator. In the last month, the Trump administration has escalated its throwdown with the university system, specifically calling out the pro-Palestinian protests and anti-semitic, and calling on universities to quash them. In a letter sent to Harvard by the same clown brigade that ordered a review of UW, the administration claimed that “Harvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment.” And among other things, they demanded that the school report “individual faculty members who discriminated against Jewish or Israeli students or incited students to violate Harvard’s rules following October 7, and the University and federal government will cooperate to determine appropriate sanctions for those faculty members within the bounds of academic freedom and the First Amendment.” The letter lists the ways Harvard can get on its knees and win its federal funding back. When Harvard refused, Trump threatened not only its federal funding, but its tax-exempt status. And just yesterday, Columbia University announced layoffs of nearly 180 people after Trump cut $400 million of federal grant funding from the university, claiming that it “repeatedly fails to protect students from anti-Semitic harassment on campus.” UW would struggle to survive a similar attack. Funding has never been more tenuous for the university. It received around $2.1 billion in federal funds for research in 2024. To make matters financially worse, the proposed state budget trims state funds allocated to UW by over $166 million. And this has been piled on top of an already struggling university budget. Back during the 2008 recession, the state cut UW’s per-student funding by half. The funding has yet to recover to where it was before 2008. According to UW Magazine, the state funded UW the same amount in 2019 as it did in 1990. Can a cash-strapped university still stay true to its values under the Trump administration? Universities have the potential to be an essential tool in standing up to dictators. UW prides itself on “being boundless,” except maybe boundlessness is limited by who holds the capital. In the 15 years Stonehill has worked at UW, he’s seen the public service mission eroded due to the loss of federal and state funding. “The university had to move more towards corporate funding and wealthy philanthropists to make things happen here,” Stonehill said. “What we're seeing now is the downside of that. Corporations like Boeing are making weapons that are being used to kill people, and we can't say anything about it because we’re reliant on their money. I’d really like for that to change.” Editor’s Note: This story has been updated to reflect new documentation that shows a collaboration proposal between Boeing and the University of Washington. It has also been updated to include more details from the SUPER UW press release.",,"['budget', 'housing', 'police']",6.0,2025-08-03T16:16:34.593635,11445

Richardson was arrested Sunday on a fourth degree domestic violence offense, according to the police report obtained by The Associated Press. On Thursday, she ran in the opening round the women's 100 meters at U.S. track and field championships in Eugene, Oregon. She has an automatic bye to the world championships in September in Tokyo as the defending champion. The 25-year-old Richardson was booked into the South Correctional Entity (SCORE) in Des Moines, Washington, at 6:54 p.m. last Sunday and released Monday at 1:13 p.m. “USATF is aware of the reports and is not commenting on this matter,” USA Track and Field said in a statement. Richardson's agent did not immediately reply to an email request for comment. The police report said an officer at the airport was notified by a Transportation Security Administration supervisor of a disturbance between Richardson and her boyfriend, sprinter Christian Coleman. The officer reviewed camera footage and observed Richardson reach out with her left arm and grab Coleman's backpack and yank it away. Richardson then appeared to get in Coleman's way with Coleman trying to step around her. Coleman was shoved into a wall. The report later said that Richardson appeared to throw an item at Coleman, which the TSA indicated may have been headphones.

The undeveloped land in the Westwood Highlands neighborhood, where not everyone is on board with the $30 million plan to build single-family homes. RELATED | Bellevue School District faces state oversight over budget shortfall, depleted reserves Following the district board sign-off on Thursday, Bellevue schools are entering into an agreement to sell off the wooded property to Tri Pointe Homes. School officials at the district board meeting explained that the more than 10-acre parcel is no longer needed and is unfit for developing a school, while the superintendent said this deal is going to accelerate the district's path to financial recovery. ""We have other properties at our disposal if we should, in the future, need to engage in the construction of another elementary school,"" BSD Chief Operating Officer Dr. Heather Sanchez explained. The $30 million proceeds will speed up the district’s new financial recovery plan by restoring the general fund reserve. The district has been under binding financial conditions with the state since July as it faces a budget crisis due to dropping enrollment, a loss of state funding, and boosted operating costs. ""Part of the reason it comes down to selling the property is not just to spend on our regular costs, but it’s also to make sure we have a reserve, which we have depleted, in order for us to come out of binding conditions,"" added Board Member Jane Aras. ""That has to happen first."" A new state law allows any Washington school district under those conditions to add the profits from a one-time sale to the district's general fund instead of the capital budget used for building projects and technology. However, not everyone is on board. One Bellevue neighbor off camera pointed out that 139th Ave. SE is the only inlet to that property. He worries that having any development could create traffic back-up on his street. Board Member Monica Webster said while the development's impacts on the neighborhood are still unclear, the school district will be responsive to people's concerns. ""The district does plan to stay attentive to any potential adjustments that might be necessary at those surrounding schools in that area if there is a need for that,"" Webster stated. The school district hopes to close the sale before Spring 2027. Also starting next year, another new state law - HB 2049 - allows the district to increase the local levy collection by $500 per student. That amounts to about $5 million for the coming school year and is expected to generate $10 million every year after that. The superintendent said this deal, combined with the local levy, will help BSD restore its budget in two to three years instead of the seven to 10 they had anticipated. People will be able to weigh in when the district has a public hearing on the budget on Aug. 21.",,"['budget', 'development', 'budget (title)']",4.0,2025-08-03T16:17:45.692694,3072
http://web.archive.org/web/20250409101602/https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/homeless/under-pressure-from-city-everett-homeless-center-finds-new-spot/,Seattle Times,"Under pressure from city, Everett homeless center finds new spot","EVERETT — Hope springs eternal. But sometimes it has to move. A day center for homeless and other struggling people reopened in a new space last week after city officials threatened to shut down the center’s old location for violating a law that prohibits street-level social services on certain downtown blocks. Rather than continue operating from a former coffee shop on Rucker Avenue, Hope ‘N Wellness is now using a Cedar Street building owned by Our Lady of Hope Catholic Church. The homeless-aid organization was facing a closure deadline of April 30 on Rucker Avenue until the church stepped up to help, so the solution is a huge relief, executive director Jasmine Donahue said. “It’s like 5,000 pounds just came off my shoulders,” she said Wednesday as Hope ‘N Wellness participants sipped coffee in metal folding chairs in the new space. At the same time, Donahue harbors mixed feelings about the move, because it means the city has succeeded in pushing Hope ‘N Wellness out of a spot with a community feeling where vulnerable people felt safe, she said. “Shoving people out doesn’t help them recover or grow,” Donahue said. Officials began pressuring the homeless center to close more than a year ago, citing complaints about loitering and camping on Rucker Avenue. They said the city’s social services ban is supposed to make downtown Everett more vibrant by creating “synergistic opportunities” for shops and restaurants. Hope ‘N Wellness supporters pushed back this winter, accusing officials of trying to spruce up the area for development by pushing homeless people and drug users out. Similar debates have flared in other Puget Sound cities struggling to revive their downtowns in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. “With the great need for social services and support locally and throughout the region, we are glad Hope ‘N Wellness found a new location,” Nichole Webber, a spokesperson for the city, said in an email this week. Hope ‘N Wellness provides free coffee, food, hygiene supplies and clothes to people coming off the streets. The center is also a place to rest, make phone calls, get counseling and meet with case managers. You don’t have to be sober and don’t have to share your whole name to spend time there. Donahue didn’t know about the city’s downtown land-use law when she founded Hope ‘N Wellness during the pandemic and didn’t hear from city officials about the law until December 2023. They initially gave her an October 2024 deadline to close or move, then extended the deadline more than once. The Rucker Avenue space was located near Everett’s library, jail and courts, and the landlord was giving Hope ‘N Wellness a discount on rent, so finding a comparable new location was challenging, Donahue said. Salvation came when Donahue heard from Dennis Kelly, a deacon at Our Lady of Hope. The church had previously talked to the city about hosting a day center in its Cedar Street accessory building, Kelly said. That plan got stuck in bureaucracy related to public funding, but the idea lingered, he said. “They’ve been wanting to do this and needed staff to run it,” Donahue said. “We’re already running it and we needed a place. It worked out perfect.” The Cedar Street building is located just outside downtown Everett, so it’s convenient for Hope ‘N Wellness participants without violating the city’s law. The center was operating one day per week on Rucker Avenue and will continue with that schedule for now, with more days possible later. The church’s bright, airy building will take some getting used to for Hope ‘N Wellness. It’s not homey like the Rucker Avenue space, which had art everywhere. But a number of participants showed up Wednesday morning, crossing a hardwood floor to grab snacks and charge their phones. Michael McCoy, who’s been homeless for a year, walked a mile to reach the center. Kevin Lanting, who’s recovering from addiction, rummaged through a bin of donated clothes, picked out a purple University of Washington shirt and launched into an analysis of the UW football team’s budding talents. “It’s a blessing to have this resource,” he said. “Everyone is welcome here.” Although Our Lady of Hope won’t impose religious requirements on Hope ‘N Wellness participants, the center’s services align with the church’s values, said Kelly, the deacon. The church serves Monday dinners to homeless people out of the building on Cedar Street and has a food bank there, too. “If Jesus were here today, what would he want us to do?” Kelly asked, explaining why the church got involved. “We serve people on the margins.” Donahue said she had a good feeling about the arrangement partly because the church’s name and her organization’s both contain the word “hope.” “It was meant to be,” Kelly said. “That’s the way we look at it.”",2025-04-07T10:00:00-07:00,"['homeless', 'development', 'homeless (title)']",4.0,2025-08-03T16:15:50.928503,4790
https://www.thestranger.com/queer/2025/02/08/79911998/trump-order-causing-document-troubles-for-trans-people,The Stranger,Trump Order Causing Document Troubles for Trans People Just Can't Get Enough?,"President Donald Trump’s first two and a half weeks in office threw the lives of transgender people in the US into chaos. Through executive orders, he’s moved to ban trans women and girls from sports, ban federal support of gender-affirming care for people age 19 and younger, and set the stage for a trans military ban under the Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. But no order has likely affected more trans people than the first he signed on Day 1 of his presidency, or “Defending Women From Gender Ideology and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” The order is a federal redefinition of sex—scrubbing all mention of trans people and trans-friendly policy from federal websites, directing federal prisons to remove trans people from the facilities that don’t align with their birth sex, banning the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care (a directive to effectively detransition those same federal prisoners who can’t get hormones any other place) and forcing trans people on Medicaid to pay for pricey drugs out of pocket. At some point, the Office of Personnel Management and Homeland Security will implement changes that require “government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards to accurately reflect the holder’s sex.” Legal challenges are already filed, including a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union challenging the state department’s “refusal to issue accurate sex designations”—these are not laws, they’re directives, and likely unconstitutional power grabs from the executive branch—but so are changes to federal policy. As we wrote last week, trans people can no longer update the gender marker on their passport or the one on file with the Social Security Administration, because, based on this redefinition, we don’t exactly have “gender markers” anymore. Instead, Trump replaced them with sex markers. His administration believes sex is locked at conception. Technically speaking, we’re nothing. We’re sexless. But the complexities, and come to think of it, simplicities, of biology, the prevalence of intersex conditions visible and invisible to the naked eye, and the demonstrable reality of gender variance in daily life, across cultures, and throughout time, is just hooey, they say. Woke, meaningless, irrelevant nonsense that must be snuffed out. We’re starting to see this ideology in practice, and it’s creating real, practical problems for trans people. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has frozen applications from people who’ve requested “X” markers or a binary change of gender, according to Denise Diskin a volunteer attorney with the LGBTQ legal advocacy organization QLaw. It now appears the only one in the business of changing gender markers is Trump: Trans people who have secured emergency replacement passports have had them returned with their gender assigned at birth. To renew a passport, applicants must send in their current one, meaning that many now find themselves without a passport and no clear timeline for when they’ll get one back. In a Friday press release, The ACLU said that 1,500 transgender people or their families had contacted the organization, reporting suspended or pending passport applications. Along with switching gender to sex on federal forms and documents, Trump’s order revoked the option for a gender neutral “X” marker on passports for non-binary people, intersex people, or anyone else who didn’t want a sex identification on their travel document. For Camins Bretts, a bald trans man with a beard and taste for expensive menswear, an “X” marker is practical. His appearance has confused border patrol agents since the 1980s. When he appeared to be a butch woman, agents saw a man fraudulently using a woman’s passport. He had the same problem after he transitioned, and really was a man using a woman’s passport. Bretts recalled all the times he’d been detained at reentry for “false documents” and laughed. “I mean, it’s a story every trans person tells me,” he says. “That’s not unique.” How he’s gendered often depends on who’s looking. The “X” marker could’ve at least put an end to consistent border troubles. On January 22, Bretts applied for an emergency passport with an “X” marker, and scheduled an appointment to pick it up on the 27th, hoping to make some last minute travel plans with friends. A few hours after Rubio reportedly sent a memo to state department employees ending the use of X markers and halting gender marker changes, Bretts’ passport momentarily disappeared in the tracking system and then reappeared three days later. At the appointment, a woman told Bretts their passport was on hold. When Bretts asked for written documentation of that, she said there was none, and no appeals process, either. Looking distressed, the woman told Bretts to print out the executive order as documentation. A supervisor nodded his head behind her. Bretts was unable to apply for a new passport under their assigned gender at birth because the Department had previously issued Bretts passports with both male and female markers. He walked away from the appointment with nothing, and no recourse, so he contacted their congressperson Pramila Jayapal and several legal organizations. On Tuesday, the Seattle passport office called to reaffirm they were not processing “X” passports. Bretts asked if that was a denial of their application, but the office couldn’t say. He’s since received notifications that their application was complete. “Called [passport] helpline,” they texted. “Still Schrodinger’s passport—‘getting ready to manufacture book and card’ according to [the] agent … They could/would not answer my q’s about when it will be ready and what gender is in it.” Evan Reding, a 24-year-old trans masculine person who passes as a cis man in daily life, says having an “F” on his passport is more of a safety concern than anything else. He hadn’t updated any of his documents prior to election day last year, but legally changed his name in December and sent in an application for a new, expedited passport on January 10th, expecting it back by at least January 31. A tracker on the State Department website shows his passport as “processing.” He checks it at least twice a day. He expects to receive a passport with an “F,” but scraping together the $600 he needed to update everything before Trump took office wasn’t easy. Reding says he wouldn’t have been able to do it without his mom’s help. The other trans people, and parents of trans children, who spoke with The Stranger asked us to use their first name or pseudonyms to protect their identities. Bailey, a trans woman also waiting for her passport, says she can afford to lose the $270 she spent, but it’s not why she went through this process. The thought that her passport may return with an “M” marker, adds to her prevailing feeling that the people in charge of this country hate her and people like her. In the months before Trump’s inauguration, 24-year-old Shiloh updated all their documents with a new name and gender marker, except the one on file with the Social Security Administration. Biggest face palm of his life, he says. It’d slipped his mind while recovering from top surgery; it’s also easy to forget. Social Security cards don’t have gender markers. They’re only visible from a SSA database called NUMIDENT, or Numerical Identification System. Shiloh evidently got lucky, or at least secured a just in time appointment with the office. They changed their marker more than a week after Trump’s order went into effect. Four days later, the SSA sent workers an “emergency message” telling them not to process gender marker changes, and to tell applicants they were “not able to accept or process a sex field change,” according to reporting from independent journalist Chris Geidner. The policy is now posted on the agency’s website. James’ daughter is trans, and they’re having trouble getting her a new passport from the State Department. They wanted to update her “X” passport to an “F,” but it’s lost in the government ether now. The family has to decide by Thursday whether or not to cancel an upcoming vacation overseas. James estimates the non-refundable hotel stay and plane tickets will be in the $10,000 range. She’s suggested staying with her grandparents if they can’t work it out in time. But money is just money, he says. But James wonders what would happen if she really needed to leave, and that passport was locked in some kind of bureaucratic morass. James has texted us regular updates about the family’s troubles. On Tuesday, they discovered Social Security processed the name change they’d submitted, but left the gender marker as “M.” That morning, he’d tried talking his way into a passport at a local office—hers was currently listed as “X.” James tried handing the employees his daughter’s updated Washington birth certificate, but says they had a record of the M on her previous passport. “They have no guidance on how to issue one otherwise since X doesn’t exist anymore,” he wrote. “I think having a passport, regardless of gender is better than no passport and being stuck.” The employees were compassionate, and heard him out even though he did not have an appointment, but there was nothing they could do but escalate his problem to their supervisor, who told him to come back with his daughter on Wednesday and submit a new application with an “M” marker. While waiting, he says he overheard employees tell a trans woman that the process had changed, and they’d mail her a passport. She flew in from Alaska, he says. James returned with his daughter on Wednesday, they were told the legal department would have to review her application. He had to write a letter explaining their situation. “I have to go back Friday and either there will be a passport or a letter from legal denying it.” James got neither. The passport office called Friday and explained they were still waiting for guidance, meaning his daughter's passport would remain in limbo. James cancelled the first leg of the family vacation. If things change, they’ll rebook. If they don’t, well, he isn’t so sure. Liz’s trans son came out shortly after the family moved from Seattle to rural Washington. She joked that he should have come out when they lived someplace with resources. But they’ve managed. “Surprisingly,” she said, he’s not the only trans kid. There’s a small community of families like theirs. He’s out at school. His identity is not a secret. Anyone who knows him knows he’s trans, which didn’t stop his civics teacher from polling his class on whether broad acceptance of trans people would be very bad for society. Eighty percent of them said “very bad.” Liz submitted a passport application for her son with an “M” marker on December 23, and arrived a week later on January 1. Liz paid for expedited service, and says the online tracker showed it would arrive in two to three weeks. Five weeks later, it still hasn’t. The tracker shows it is “in process.” Liz thinks her son’s delayed passport has been overwhelming for him, but his main concern is missing out on a trip to Asia this spring. He doesn’t understand the gravity of the situation in the way she does. No one around her seems to. She says it’s as if people almost expect trans people to be discriminated against. They don’t see these orders as extreme as they should. “The thought of an American citizen being denied this and that being okay with people—not just my son, but all trans and non-binary kids and adults,” she says. “To oppress a whole group of people on a federal level. That’s what scares me.”",,"['election', 'policy']",4.0,2025-08-03T16:16:34.592635,11638

Jordyn Weichert, 35, has been identified as the suspect in an August 3 release by King County prosecutors. PREVIOUS COVERAGE | Man killed in stabbing, second person found dead on bus a block away The victim, identified as Ramon Aragon-Garcia, 55, was found around 6:20 p.m. on July 14, in the SODO neighborhood. A distressed man waved down King County deputies in the area for an unrelated call, telling them that his friend had been murdered in a white van. Upon entering the van, they found the body of Aragon-Garcia and a knife. According to court documents compiled during the investigation, Weichert was seen entering Ramon Aragon-Garcia's van on the evening of the 14th. Witnesses reported hearing a male voice say ""stop it"" from inside the van, and surveillance footage captured Weichert leaving the van with what appeared to be blood on her chest. The documents state that surrounding video surveillance cameras at very locations showed no one but Weichert entering and leaving the van during the estimated time before the discovery of the body. The Seattle Police Department's investigation revealed that Aragon-Garcia suffered multiple stab wounds, including to his head, face, arms, and a fatal injury to his femoral artery. The medical examiner classified the death as a homicide. Court documents note that prior to the killing, Weichert and Aragon-Garcia were known to each other and seemed to be friendly. SEE ALSO | Person of interest wanted after man found stabbed to death in van in SODO After several days spent trying to track down Weichert, including with the help of civilian tips, law enforcement arrested her on July 29. She is being held $5 million bail, and the state has requested electronic home detention with GPS tracking if she posts bail, citing concerns for community safety and the likelihood of future violence. Notably, court documents state that she has three prior convictions for vehicular homicide and two convictions for vehicular assault, all stemming from one incident. Washington state has a ""three strikes law,"" which mandates life imprisonment without parole for people convicted of three ""most serious offenses,"" which include Class A felonies. The law is meant to protect public safety by incapacitating habitual violent offenders. Vehicular homicide counts as a class A felony, which Weichert has 3 convictions of. However, the King County Prosecuting Attorney Office noted that ""convictions stemming from the same incident are not counted as separate strikes under Washington law,"" meaning that despite having 3 Class A convictions, she would only incur one ""strike"" in the system.",,"['public safety', 'police']",4.0,2025-08-03T16:17:45.694057,2889

The fire, which is human-caused, continues to burn in steep and rugged terrain, posing challenges for firefighting efforts. PREVIOUSLY | Level 3 evacuation orders issued for Bear Gulch fire burning in Mason County Increased humidity has helped moderate the fire's growth, but firefighters remain engaged in both day and night operations to protect structures and other critical values at risk. The fire has crossed Copper Creek, and crews are using sprinkler systems around cabins and structures while removing flammable materials to reduce fire potential. Efforts are underway to enhance road systems east of the fire to make them more defensible, and crews are identifying natural features northwest of the fire to halt its northward progression. Drones are being used for reconnaissance and to strategically apply fire to remove fuels from the advancing main fire. On the southern portion of Lake Cushman, crews are accessing remote sections by boat to protect structures, timber, and power infrastructure. Five helicopters are supporting these operations. The fire is expected to persist in the Daniel J. Evans and Mount Skokomish Wilderness areas until extinguished by fall rains and snow. Weather conditions remain warm and dry, with light winds and moderate humidity recovery. Cooler conditions and light showers are anticipated late next week. Lake Cushman has been closed to public use in support of suppression and evacuation efforts. Campfires are prohibited in Olympic National Forest and Olympic National Park, and all outdoor burning is banned in Mason County. Numerous road, trail, and campground closures are in effect for public safety. Detailed information on Olympic National Forest closures can be found HERE. Evacuation orders are in place, with the Bear Gulch Fire area near Dry Creek Trail under a Level 3 ""GO"" evacuation, including the Staircase Campground. Areas south of Dry Creek are under a Level 2 ""BE SET"" notice. A Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the fire area. Officials urge the public to avoid flying drones near the fire, as this grounds firefighting aircraft. The Olympic National Forest is seeking public assistance in investigating the fire's origin.

https://www.thestranger.com/stranger-election-control-board/2025/07/19/80156072/vote-yes-on-the-king-county-parks-levy,The Stranger,Vote Yes on the King County Parks Levy Just Can't Get Enough?,"Should we or should we not have a county parks system? The question before voters is that simple. Because if voters do not approve this property tax levy, we functionally won’t have one. The 6-year levy, last approved by voters in 2019, will support 250 parks in King County 185 miles of regional trails, 215 miles of backcountry trails and 50 square miles of open space for we, the people, to frolic, picnic, bike, and aimlessly wander. There’s splash parks, pools, ballfields, and play courts of various kinds for racket-oriented aristocrats. If we renew this levy, we maintain that system and homeowners pay 24 cents per thousand dollars of their home value each month. For the median homeowner, that comes out to $16.38 a month. It would generate $1.45 billion over the next six years. If we don’t renew this levy, say goodbye to new infrastructure improvements. Advocates say the county would close parks, or put up signs telling people to recreate at their own risk. Lawns will grow long, hedges wild. After-school programs that depend on county parks funding will suffer. We hope you and your kids like pissing yourselves, because we won’t have anybody to open the restrooms. It’s not a world we want to live in. When the SECB suggested we hold our endorsement meeting in a park, it could not have known we’d meet with this levy’s well-prepared stakeholders on the hottest day of the year so far, a 90+ degree scorcher, with glaring, headache-inducing sunlight bouncing from the concrete like a mirror. We could go on complaining about this thing that was our fault, but it wouldn’t be fair to the people who sat on the porch outside the community center at the genuinely lovely Steve Cox Memorial Park in White Center with us, or the “Log Cabin,” as it is affectionately known. It’d be especially unfair to Fin Crispy Jr., the mascot of the park’s resident summer collegiate baseball team, The DubSea Fish Sticks. They were getting deep fried in there. We didn’t see you leave Fin Crispy Jr., but hope you survived, even if childhood experiences have made some of our stomachs twist into knots whenever mascots are near (it’s a combination of your large size, wide-open, smiling mouths, and mime-like silence. It’s very disconcerting). Like we said, this levy is a no-brainer. It is also uncontested. The advocates, including County Council Member Teresa Mosqueda and Christie True, the county’s former head of natural resources and parks, could have easily shown up, sat down, told us to “vote for this or the parks are screwed,” and called it a day. But they came with data. With a deep love of the parks. Even answers for why the wealthy, who don’t think the county parks are worth a few quarters a day when their backyard, waterfront tennis courts are right there, should vote for this. No matter how rich they are, they don’t own Tiger Mountain, where they race wildly-expensive mountain bikes (yet), or the county-owned pool where little Richie Rich III has his swim meets. If this is you, and “eyesores” are one of your top concerns, consider the weeds. Are you going to schlep a bag and a weeder to your local park, or are you willing to cough up less than a dollar a day so someone else will? We’re willing to bet that’s less than the going rate for a gardener. But those homeowners would probably know better than us. When we pool our money together, we can all have nice things. Even those with little to spare. In Seattle, we’re lousy with parks. But many of the diverse, immigrant populated areas of unincorporated King County aren’t. They depend on this money. Everyone deserves a place to play, to enjoy themselves, to throw a party, to organize a cultural event, and not have to pay for it. Bummed about another property tax?

Keeping these parks open and thriving at a time when we’re still trying to recover from the isolation and depression of the pandemic and so much public money is under federal threat is literally our civic duty.

The people there surely felt it, but no one, according to recent reports, was killed or seriously injured. The world-historical seismic event triggered tsunami warnings in Hawaii, French Polynesia, Japan, Peru, and Chile. It seems our planet's largest ocean was sloshing about like bathtub water bothered by a soap-lathering bather. This morning, however, almost all tsunami warnings have been downgraded, and the shores of our region of America—California, Oregon, Washington—only experienced waves that were more curious than destructive. Now, let's get back to the Epstein files. No, let's talk about the weather instead. The experts predict that today will be as hot as yesterday, reaching a very uncomfortable 81. But starting tomorrow, things will start to get cooler and cooler. Indeed, next week will open with temperatures in the low 70s. The chance of rain, however, will remain depressingly low. Sorry trees, sorry grass, sorry to all of the life forms that use sunlight and water to produce out of thin air the most original food in the world. Columbia Funeral Home and Crematory, which has been around forever (since 1907), was damaged to a considerable degree by a fire that the Seattle Fire Department confronted at 4 am this morning and extinguished an hour and half later. The funeral home, which is famous for displaying glowing Nativity ornaments on its lawn during the holiday season, had planned to send one of the city's souls to the other side of eternity this Friday. That's not going to happen. Though SFD claimed ""no one [was] in the building when the fire broke out,"" it's uncertain if it categorized a dead person as ""no one."" Nevertheless, investigators believe that arson is at the bottom of this bad business. The Pacific Science Center's huge mechanical dinosaurs will lose their jobs after Labor Day. For four decades, these ""animatronic beasts"" did their damndest to please young and old visitors. And all for what? To get the boot. Their bosses had this to say about them: “They’ve far exceeded expectations thanks to the tireless, heroic efforts of our Pacific Science Center staff.” Where do they go from here? No one wants to say. But they will be replaced by an exhibit devoted to spiders. Who cares that Finland's geese turn the food they consume into waste? What is the story here, Seattle Times? Someone or another had this to say about Helsinki's public beaches: “[They are covered by] a shocking amount of [goose] poop.” But visit the park—Creekside Park—next to Vancouver BC's palatial Pacific Central Station, and you will also a ""shocking amount of [goose] poop."" Do I have to say it? Yes, I must. Shit happens. And what's this? A 15-year-old boy from a drive-past town in southwest Washington, Chehalis, wants to become, when he is old enough, the governor of a state whose GNP is approaching $1 trillion and, as a consequence, has the 4th-highest GDP per capita in the nation. The boy is a Republican. He wants to give lots of money to cops. He also thinks taxes are very bad, and so on and so on. But will someone in Chehalis tell this boy that Washington State is already on the A-list when it comes to capitalism. We, a blue state (surprise!), slam dunk that shit like Sasquatch launched from a trampoline. In short, we couldn't do the big business of accumulating capital any better. You, my boy, live at the end of the world, when it comes down to private enterprise. Now, go back to school, put on the cap with the propeller, and try to think of something that our state doesn't do so well. Something we are truly lousy at. Will someone also tell the boy in Chehalis that climate change is really something that should be on his mind? The world is already getting hotter by the day; and it's going to be even hotter in 2028, the year he plans to run for the highest office in this state. Smoke from the Bear Gulch Fire in the Olympic National Park has finally reached the Puget Sound. The fire, which was first reported two days after Independence Day, and, presently, is only 10 percent contained, has already burnt more than 1000 acres to a crisp. Now that FEMA is being dismantled, we are required to learn from ""extreme weather survivors"" the best way to deal with a disaster on your own. Please forward this message to the people of islands in the Pacific, Bangladesh and Somalia. The present aggressive and unrelenting restructuring of American society uses old tools to build something that's unprecedented: subjects who are adapted to accelerating value formation and concentration in a world whose climate has changed dramatically. The destruction of FEMA, basic weather monitoring, NASA's climate science has its logic in the formation of a population that will be spiritually (which is the same as physically) powerless upon the full arrival of a geological era that will demand, if an approximation of a morally adequate response is to be achieved, greater social cooperation and, as a consequence, the deceleration, if not entire replacement, of the dream of endless economic growth. ICE, concentration camps, the brazen shredding of basic civil rights—clearly, we are being conditioned for the continuation of surplus value accumulation in the ecological aftermath. This is bizarre indeed. But the Department of the Treasury is accepting donations via Venmo to help reduce the US’ $36 trillion debt. Do not do this. It’s the dumbest thing ever proposed in the history of American finance. And not because your pennies will not make a dent on this debt; it’s dumb because the US keeps cutting taxes on the rich and the corporations they own. This Venmo thing is nothing but a performance to make the greatest tools among us feel patriotic. What’s next? A GoFundMe for the US government? For real, a fool and their money soon part.

(Still from video posted by Sanders) TOPICS: THURSTON COUNTY, Wash. — A routine traffic stop turned violent for Thurston County's Sheriff Sanders when he was assaulted by the driver, the sheriff reported on social media. The incident began when a Sanders observed a white work truck traveling at 53 mph in a 35 mph zone on Steilacoom Road. SEE ALSO | VIDEO: Thurston County deputies use grappler to stop 130 mph chase on I-5 The truck nearly rear-ended another vehicle, passed it in a no-pass zone, and then sped away. Sanders tried to initiate a traffic stop, but the driver refused to pull over, fleeing to their driveway. Sanders said that upon exiting the truck with a drink in hand, the driver refused to cooperate with commands and tried to run inside their house. The sheriff reported that the suspect ""doused me in the face and eyes with what smelled like sweet liquor,"" leading to a physical altercation. During the struggle, the suspect grabbed the sheriff's vest, turned off the radio, and ripped off the lapel mic. The suspect also grabbed the sheriff's throat. A taser was deployed but failed due to the close proximity. A nearby neighbor intervened, helping Sanders subdue the suspect. A K9 arrived on the scene and bit the suspect on the ear, prompting the suspect to surrender. The suspect was placed in a WRAP restraint system due to continued threats and resistance. A warrant was obtained to test the suspect's blood for intoxicants, and he was taken to the hospital for medical clearance. The suspect will face charges including reckless driving, DUI, felony assault on a peace officer, obstructing, resisting arrest, failure to obey a police officer, and driving on a suspended license. The suspect's family told the TCSO they had offered him a ride home from an event, which he refused, and that he did not have permission to drive the family company vehicle. The decision was made not to impound the vehicle, as the family needed it for their livelihood. The neighbor who assisted the deputy was awarded a Sheriff challenge coin for their swift action.",,['police'],2.0,2025-08-03T16:17:45.694057,2396

A: We publish all of the stories, columns and photos produced by Seattle Times staff, but some of the wire services do not allow us to post their material online. So the print edition contains some syndicated columns, graphics and other content not available online. Q: Why does The Seattle Times require a subscription for complete digital access? A: The expenses associated with creating unique, original news content are significant. Traditionally, the great majority of the cost was underwritten by advertising. With the changing media business model, that revenue no longer covers costs to the same degree. As a result, in order to maintain the same high quality, unique news gathering, it is necessary to charge for unlimited digital access, just as is done for the printed product. Q: If I am already a home delivery subscriber, how do I get digital access? A: Every print subscription includes unlimited access to seattletimes.com, Seattle Times mobile apps for iOS and Android, and Print Replica for iPad and Android tablet, an online version of the printed paper.

A: The Subscriber Rewards program offers subscribers great deals in their inboxes every week. Go to the newsletters page and select the Subscriber Rewards newsletter.

We want the stories, visuals, columns and editorials we publish to be a starting point for conversation, not a dead end. The goal of commenting is to maintain a civil space where people who live in or care about the Pacific Northwest can have meaningful, informed conversations about the facts presented in The Seattle Times. How do I report a comment that breaks the rules? Bring it to our attention by clicking on the ""report"" link that appears with each comment. We will review it as soon as possible (at times there could be a delay of a few hours). Who reviews the reported comments? The Seattle Times' digital audience team and other staff in the newsroom. As a Seattle Times subscriber, can I still be suspended or banned from commenting? Yes, the Code of Conduct applies to all users, regardless of subscription status. If you violate the Code of Conduct, your commenting privileges may be suspended or revoked, but you will still be able to read articles. Will you tell me when I’ve been suspended or banned? Will you tell me why? And can I be reinstated? If you are suspended or banned from commenting, we will notify you via the email address associated with your commenting account. The first violation of the Code of Conduct results in a 24-hour suspension -- essentially, a warning. If you break the rules again after that, you'll be banned. Bans are permanent. Why are you censoring peoples’ opinions? The Seattle Times reserves the right to allow or disallow any kind of content that doesn't meet its standards as outlined in the Code of Conduct, Terms of Service and this FAQ. The Times is under no obligation to publish every comment it receives. Generally, a comment is removed not because of the opinion it expresses but because it violates those basic rules. What about my right to free speech? The right to free speech described in the First Amendment concerns the relationship between the U.S. government and its citizens. Any private business can require certain standards of conduct, as we do with our Code of Conduct. Why can’t I comment on wire stories? As of May 15, 2017, The Seattle Times is not accepting reader comments on news stories originating with The Associated Press, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Bloomberg and other wire services. The intent is to focus our newsroom's time and energy on discussions related to news stories covered by our staff, and foster constructive conversation around local news and issues. Why don’t you make commenters use real names? We have considered requiring real names, and decided not to for a few reasons. First, we don't have the resources to independently verify that names used by commenters are indeed real. Some sites have tried to get around this by connecting comments to Facebook profiles. But Facebook's verification mechanisms are imperfect as well, and not everyone has a Facebook profile. We think you shouldn't have to join another site to have conversations on ours. Plus, our commenting vendor — unlike Facebook — keeps users’ data private. Another reason for not requiring real names: Research on commenting communities shows that using real names doesn't actually compel people to act more civilly toward each other. Comments on Facebook posts offer countless examples of this. There's also evidence that, when commenters are all using their real names, people with names that suggest they're women or people of color are more likely to be harassed, and we don't want to invite those kinds of attacks into our community. The folks who built our commenting tool published an enlightening piece on this subject; we invite you to read it. What is the ""respect"" link for? This allows you to convey respect for a particularly thoughtful, well-reasoned contribution from a fellow reader. You may use it once per comment. Why don’t you pre-screen all of the comments? We do actively moderate and pre-screen comments on some stories when there's a high likelihood the discussion will stray off topic. But we don't have the staff resources to read and approve every comment on our site before it is posted. That's why we provide readers the tools to help us keep the conversation civil through the ""report"" and ""respect"" links. We encourage readers to report comments that violate the Code of Conduct. Why do you require a subscription in order to comment? We made this decision based on the amount of time necessary to moderate comments that violate our code of conduct. It helps keep spam out of the comments. It allows us to better control the legitimacy of commenters. And adding the step of having to be subscribed and logged in deters the hit-and-run troll. Can I change the way I view the comments? Yes. By default, you'll see featured comments first. If no comments have been featured on that thread yet, you'll see all the comments chronologically beginning with the newest first. At the top of each comment thread (above the first comment), you'll see options to sort the comments in other ways. Can I see another user's commenting history? No. However, you can see your own commenting history, and you can see how long someone has been a member of the commenting community. Can I edit or remove a comment after I've posted it? You have the option to edit a comment for up to 5 minutes after you post it. But you cannot remove a comment, so please be absolutely sure you want to make such a comment publicly. Comments are indexed by search engines, and they also could remain on our site for many years. Why do comments close 72 hours after an article is published? You can still read others' thoughts after 72 hours, but indeed will not be able to contribute your own. Limiting commenting on old stories keeps our moderators focused on the stories that have the most readers at the time. Why do old stories not have comment threads anymore? We changed commenting systems in April 2019. Unfortunately, issues with technology, different vendors and resources kept us from being able to preserve old comments when we made this change. What are some other ways to share my thoughts on news stories and topics of the day? If you'd like to give input on issues raised in an article, and that article doesn't have a comment thread, you've still got several other opportunities. Here are a few of them: The Seattle Times’ commenting community is a civil space where people who live in or otherwise care about the Pacific Northwest can have meaningful, informed conversations about the facts presented in The Times. Our newsroom strives to reflect the vibrancy and diversity of the region and tell the story of its continuing transformation. We aim to be a model of innovative, audience-supported regional journalism, to strengthen democracy, build community, encourage constructive discourse and enrich people’s lives. Seattle Times staff retains the prerogative to determine what is published on seattletimes.com. To that end, just as we hold our journalism to high ethical standards, we hold comments published alongside our work to high ethical standards. This is a living document. We expect to revise these guidelines in response to community feedback and behavior. Tips for constructive commenting Our commenters represent a variety of identities, perspectives and life experiences, which inform the well-reasoned opinions they share with their neighbors on our site. Here’s how you can help us foster an inclusive, respectful environment for everyone who visits or participates in the comments: Unacceptable behavior If your comment reflects any of the following, it will be removed and you may be suspended from commenting on seattletimes.com. If you violate this code of conduct repeatedly, you will be permanently banned. Seattle Times staff retain sole discretion to moderate, suspend or ban anyone whose behavior we determine to be a detriment to the atmosphere of our site. We will take into account both individual comments and a commenter’s past behavior when making these decisions. More information about how commenting works Comments containing links to sites that do not conform to these guidelines will also be removed. In some cases, we might pre-moderate comments containing links. If a comment is removed, all replies to that comment are hidden. Decisions to remove a comment, or to suspend a user, are final. A user who has been banned may appeal to customercare@seattletimes.com to request the ban be changed to a suspension at our staff’s discretion. A user may make only one such appeal; there are no third chances. Stories from wire services, such as The Associated Press or New York Times, do not have comment threads. We are focusing our limited staff time on discussions around stories produced by The Seattle Times. Comment threads automatically close to new submissions 72 hours after an article is published. Seattle Times staff may also use our discretion to close comments on an article at any time for a variety of ethical and/or practical reasons. Talk to us If you have questions about anything related to our commenting community, please email customercare@seattletimes.com. Commenting isn’t the only way to share your thoughts about the news. Reporters’ contact information is listed on their articles so you can reach out to them directly. You can also submit a letter or Op-Ed about a local topic to be considered for publication in the Opinion section. Q: Where do I send comments or requests about newspaper home delivery? A: Please send comments and requests regarding home delivery to customercare@seattletimes.com or call Customer Service at 206.464.2121 or 1.800.542.0820 (mobile phones only outside of the U.S. and Canada).

During this time, although your newspaper will not be delivered, your subscription continues with full access to all our digital platforms, including seattletimes.com, mobile apps for iOS and Android and the digital Print Replica, and exact copy of the printed paper online.

Letters to the editor are an important part of the Opinion section. Our readers share a wide range of perspectives on current issues. Letters that are well-written, have a clear opinion, are responsive to current events and keep to the word count are more likely to be chosen for publication. We always try to give preference to The Seattle Times’ critics in choosing letters to be published. Opinions that differ from those presented elsewhere on the editorial and Opinion pages are also given priority. The Times also seeks to publish letters from a range of readers of diverse backgrounds with priority given to those in Washington state. Letters should be 200 words or fewer. When submitting a letter, please include the topic or headline and date of The Seattle Times article, editorial or opinion piece to which your letter refers. We only accept letters via email. All letters must include your full name (no initials), address and telephone number for verification. Your residential address and personal phone number, used for verification purposes, will not be published. Your name and city of residence are published as a letter’s signature. We do not publish letters written anonymously or under pseudonyms. Please do not expect us to publish letters from a single writer more frequently than once every three months to give other readers a chance to express their opinions. If your letter is selected for publication, you may be contacted for identity verification or if we have questions about its content. Letters become the property of The Seattle Times and may be edited. Email to: letters@seattletimes.com Writing guidelines: Do’s and Don’ts DO: Have an opinion and state it forcefully — Many letters submitted are explanations of an issue or a restatement of a news article, rather than knowledgeable arguments about an issue. Those won’t make the cut. DO: Be civil and constructive — It’s perfectly appropriate to strongly criticize ideas, reasoning or positions that you disagree with. But it is not appropriate to make personal attacks. DO: Be timely — We prefer letters about current events rather than something that happened months ago. Address issues covered by The Times in recent weeks. Make sure a letter submission contains the most recent updates on a news topic. DO: Cite sources and provide context — Please include URLs for statistics, facts and reports mentioned in your letter submission. This helps the editor fact-check letters. DO: Submit a letter only to The Seattle Times — If your letter has been sent to another publication or published elsewhere in print, on a personal blog or on Facebook, we will not be able to use it. DO: Submit as text — Please include the text of the submission in the body of the email or in an attached Microsoft Word document. Please do not send us files in PDF format. DON’T: Send a PR pitch or send a letter as part of a campaign — Don’t submit a letter related to your organization’s event or as part of a letter campaign. News tips should be sent to newstips@seattletimes.com. DON’T: Demand a letter be removed once it is published — The Times does not remove content online once it has been published. If something needs correcting, please follow up with an email to letters@seattletimes.com. Contact the letters editor Letters editor Agnes Torres Al-Shibibi can be reached at aalshibibi@seattletimes.com The Seattle Times welcomes guest opinion submissions. We receive dozens of essays a week but usually can publish just one op-ed per day. To be considered, a submission should offer a strong opinion and be no more than 650 words. If you do not hear from us within FIVE business days, it's likely we will not be publishing your submission. Due to the volume of submissions we receive, we can't reply to each pitch, even though we'd like to! An opinion essay is for making arguments or comments on public policy or issues in the news. It is not a place for organizations or agencies merely to report on programs, or for outlining the history of an issue and failing to take a side. We give highest priority to local writers writing about Northwest topics. In most cases we will not run Op-Eds from candidates running for office. We require first-publication rights, for print and online, to all of our submissions. If your essay has been published elsewhere in print or online, including on social media, or has been presented as testimony in a public setting, such as a hearing, we will not be able to use it. When we use a freelance article from you, you retain ownership of any copyright to the article and the right to resell it, subject to our right to edit, publish, republish and reproduce the article in publications and reprints of The Seattle Times Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. This includes non-exclusive rights to use the article, in whole or in part, in electronic media, including searchable databases and electronic publications in any form and medium, which may include commercial database services where your work may be individually accessed. Where to Send Please send your submission by email: oped@seattletimes.com Please include the text of the submission in the body of the email. Don't send it as a PDF or Word attachment. Don't send a link to another program, like a Google doc; we will not open unsolicited links. We do not publish guest essays written anonymously or under pseudonyms. Nor should writers have any direct financial ties to the subject of the essay. If there could be any question, please disclose that up front. We do not pay for submissions. Please include a biography of 30 words or fewer. Please include URLs for statistics, facts and reports mentioned in your guest essay. Writing guidelines: Do's and Don'ts for Op-ed Writers DO have an opinion and state it forcefully. Essays should not be explanations of an issue; rather they should include knowledgeable arguments about an issue. DO be civil. It's appropriate to strongly criticize ideas, reasoning or positions that you disagree with. But it is not appropriate to make personal attacks. DO present the case from the top down. Begin with the premise of your opinion rather than assembling the facts and presenting an opinion at the end. DO be timely. Editorial sections prefer articles about current events rather than something that happened last year. DO be patient. We usually work at least a week in advance. DON'T submit essays that are written by organizations and then shopped around for an author or authors. That's a petition, not an essay. Keep the number of bylines to three or fewer. DON'T submit an ""open letter"" to an official or group. An op-ed is not a letter. DON'T key the essay to an invented ""public awareness"" event, such as Intellectual Property Day or Public Hospital Week. Indeed there might be something valuable and newsworthy to say about issues related to those or other areas, but the essay will be judged on its authentic news value, not on a created awareness event. DON'T demand review of editing or headlines. Most editors are willing to discuss editing changes for brevity or clarity but are seldom patient with nitpicking. Titles on articles submitted are rarely used. Headlines are written by staff copy editors who specialize in that skill. It is not unusual for headlines in print and online to be different. DON'T submit the same piece to different publications at the same time. Editors hate to see a piece in progress appear in another print or online publication. For questions: Melissa Davis, deputy opinion editor, mdavis@seattletimes.com Q: How do I navigate the website? Where do I find the comics, games, obituaries, etc.?

But while the headlines are a disaster buffet, and no, you can’t skip the sides, thank the maker for small mercies (at least if you live in Seattle): clear skies and a high of 85. Sure, the world spirals into climate collapse and political absurdity, at least the sun’s still pretending everything’s fine. Not all of Western Washington is catching a break, though. Temps hit the 90s in some areas yesterday, and since we now live in a world where the weather is actively trying to kill us, the National Weather Service has extended its Heat Advisory through Thursday for parts of the Puget Sound region. Meanwhile, the Cascades are under a Red Flag Warning thanks to hot, dry, wildfire-friendly conditions. The NWS is basically pleading with people not to keel over in the heat, especially the young, the elderly, and anyone stuck without A/C. So here’s the plan: hydrate, avoid the sun like it’s your ex with a grudge, and try not to burst into flames before the weekend. The Tooth Fairy Lives in Seattle: I know this isn’t the most important story, but hell, we’re going to need to start off with something light. Dr. Purva Merchant, a pediatric dentist in the 206, has been the secret Tooth Fairy for the past 20 years, quietly replying to over 6,000 email pleas from kids and parents around the world. What started as a fluke email grew into a mission to “preserve the magic”, sending whimsical, comforting responses (and a dollar or two) to reassure kids that growing up isn’t so scary. Signed off with a warm “Happy growing up,” her notes are a reminder that small acts of kindness can shield innocence in a world that’s increasingly harsh. Fiscal Gaslighting: Senate Republicans pushed through a $9 billion Trump-backed clawback package that guts funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting, including NPR and PBS. Of course, nothing says “fiscal sanity” like cutting global health programs and public media in the middle of multiple crises. The bill passed by a razor-thin margin, with all Democrats and two Republicans voting no, and now heads back to the House. GOP leaders are calling it a commonsense move against “waste,” but let’s be real—this is about flexing power, punishing programs they politically dislike, and handing Trump another symbolic win. But There’s Always Money for the Pentagon: Don’t worry, folks, if you thought maybe, just maybe, we’d cut a few bucks from the Pentagon’s bloated murder fund to help people not die in a flood or starve during a heatwave, think again. Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Act” cranks military spending up to a trillion dollars because apparently national security these days equates to 178 megatons of carbon emissions and enough firepower to blow up a planet we’re already cooking alive. Meanwhile, Americans are drowning, burning, or sizzling like bacon in a cast iron pan, and the response from the government is: cut food stamps, slash disaster aid, and cancel climate programs because that money is needed for bombs and billionaire tax breaks. Central Banking, Now a Bloodsport: In true Trump fashion, a meeting that was supposed to be about crypto turned into a vent session about one of his favorite punching bags: Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Trump waved around a draft letter to fire Powell like it was show-and-tell, griping that interest rates are too high and hinting (without evidence… surprise, surprise) that the Fed’s building renovation might be riddled with fraud. While some insiders say he’s just trolling, MAGA loyalists like Rep. Anna Paulina Luna are already cheering for Powell’s head on a pike. If Trump actually goes through with it, it’d be an unprecedented assault on Fed independence, and a reckless flex that could rattle the entire economy. Coincidentally, Maurene Comey, daughter of former FBI Director James Comey, has been fired from her role as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York. She helped put Epstein’s partner in crime, Ghislaine Maxwell, behind bars and led separate cases against both Epstein and Sean “Diddy” Combs. Apparently, her last name was too much baggage for an administration hellbent on revenge and image control. No explanation given—just another quiet purge from a Justice Department that’s starting to look more like a loyalty cult than a legal institution. All of this comes as Trump World scrambles to bury the Epstein case, and maybe anyone who ever tried to expose it. Trump Melts Down Over Epstein “Hoax”: In a chronic case of being unable to put the genie back in the bottle, Donald Trump continues his meltdown over the Epstein files after his own supporters refuse to let the story die. Trump, never one to handle being questioned (especially by his own base), went full unhinged boomer on Truth Social, rage-posting like a rejected Reddit mod and calling his supporters “weaklings.” He went on to accuse them of falling for a “radical left” scam. Meanwhile, MAGA loyalists and Republican heavyweights, from Marjorie Taylor Greene to Mike Johnson are demanding transparency, forcing Trump into the awkward position of disowning the very conspiracies he once perpetuated. Elon Musk, never one to miss a messy moment, chimed in to mock Trump’s “hoax” claims, basically telling him: if it’s fake, release the damn files. While I’m not holding my breath, if we’re lucky, this Epstein fiasco could do what no indictment or insurrection ever could: split MAGA from its messiah. Thanks for Your Service! Now Let’s Deport Your Dad: Narciso Barranco, a father of three U.S. Marines, was just released after spending weeks in federal custody for the crime of… mowing a lawn while undocumented. ICE agents tackled him outside an IHOP, pinned him to the ground, and accused him of assault with a weed whacker. However, no assault charges were filed, of course, just the usual “you don’t belong here” charge from a country built entirely by people who didn’t belong here. His son, a Marine vet, picked him up and said what we’re all thinking: “We give everything to this country, and they still come for our parents.” Welcome to America, where the flag-waving never stops, but the compassion sure as hell does. Israel has killed 93 Palestinians in just the last 24 hours, striking civilians sheltering in schools, and even a church. An Israeli tank shelled the Holy Family Church, killing two women and injuring a disabled child and the parish priest, because apparently no place is sacred anymore. In Khan Younis, what was billed as “aid” turned into horror when guards with the U.S.- and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation allegedly fired tear gas into a starving crowd, triggering a deadly stampede. Survivors aren’t buying the PR, demanding not food drops under fire, but open borders and the basic right to survive. Pickleball for the Housed, Silence for the Displaced: A 54,000-square-foot indoor pickleball facility, Pickle at the Palms, is now under construction in the Interbay neighborhood, on the former site of Salmon Bay Village, a city-sanctioned RV and tiny home community for unhoused residents. The project, led by Seattle Storm co-owner Ginny Gilder and her family, promises a “premium” experience for pickleball enthusiasts, but has raised uncomfortable questions about what happened to the roughly 50 people displaced when the site shut down in May. While developers talk about community and the rise of America’s trendiest sport, nearby residents like 82-year-old Penny Fuller are asking the more pressing question: “Where do those people now live?” Puppy Saved by Narcan: In a moment that somehow manages to be both heartbreaking and weirdly hopeful, a Lacey paramedic had to administer Narcan to a puppy likely exposed to fentanyl during a police investigation in a parked car. The little guy was unresponsive, barely breathing, until a small dose of the overdose-reversing drug brought him back. Within minutes, he was awake, tail wagging, and licking everyone like he just saved them. He’s now in the care of animal services. To Leave You On: Yeah, this story’s a few days old, but it needs to be dragged back into the spotlight because it’s the kind of thing that slips into silence if we let it. Youman Wilder, founder of the Harlem Baseball Hitting Academy, had ICE agents roll up unannounced to a kids’ baseball practice on the Upper West Side and start interrogating his players, mostly Black and Latino teens, about where they and their parents were from. Wilder stepped in like any decent human should, told the armed goons the kids would be exercising their Fifth Amendment rights, and called the whole thing what it was: state-sanctioned intimidation. But here’s the part that guts you, speaking on MSNBC, he said what hurt most wasn’t the agents, but the people around them who said nothing. “I saw cowards,” he said. “And I hate to say that as somebody who loves their city.” Ultimately, this isn’t just about ICE or one coach. It’s about what happens when cruelty shows up in public, and the crowd looks down at their phones. If we want to resist the machinery of fear and control that defines our current regime, then courage can’t be rare.

Thousands attended a “Hands Off!” demonstration at Seattle Center, one of the more than 1,200 planned nationwide by civil rights organizations, labor unions, LGBTQ+ advocates, veterans and elections activists. They crowded on lawns, walkways, staircases and other areas at Seattle Center, many entirely out of earshot of the rally speakers. More As their signs indicated, there was no shortage of issues drawing the people to the protest. Some were specific to policies and targets of the Trump administration, like “Migrant rights are human rights” and “Hands Off Medicaid.” Others broadly condemned the current administration’s actions with messages like “Stop Project 2025” and “Fight Fascism.” Still more read “Hands off unions,” “Hands off schools,” “Hands off free speech,” and “Fight Oligarchy.” Several Palestinian flags and a few Ukrainian flags were also seen. Speaking to the crowd, U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Seattle, called out Trump and billionaire Elon Musk — who owns Tesla, SpaceX and the social media platform X, and leads the Department of Government Efficiency — during her impassioned speech. “I want to be clear, trans kids didn’t hike your rent, billionaires did,” Jayapal said. “Immigrants did not make your groceries more expensive, billionaires did. Federal workers did not take away your health care, billionaires did.” It was difficult to estimate crowd size, but nearly 7,000 registered for Saturday’s protest at Seattle Center, according to organizers, which included Seattle Indivisible, Planned Parenthood Alliance Advocates, Evergreen Resistance and the “50501” movement, which stands for 50 protests, 50 states, one day. “Trump and Musk are taking a chain saw to our democracy,” said Alex Fayer, president of Seattle Indivisible, in a news release. “We are sad. We are angry. But we are not afraid.” Rallies were also scheduled to take place in Bellingham; Bothell; Chelan; Deming, Whatcom County; Edmonds; Ellensburg; Everett; Everson, Whatcom County; Friday Harbor; Gig Harbor; Issaquah; Kirkland; Langley, Island County; Longview; Mount Vernon; Oak Harbor; Olympia; Orcas Island, San Juan County; Port Angeles; Port Orchard; Port Townsend; Pullman; Redmond; Shaw Island, San Juan County; Spokane; Vancouver; Whidbey Island; and Yakima. The action to protest the Trump administration comes just 75 days into Trump’s second term. In that short time, the Trump administration’s decisions have caused upheaval in Washington, D.C., and virtually every foreign capital, as it pushes tectonic changes to the nation’s immigration and trade policies, and wades into conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. Washington state has been far from immune to Trump’s work. Tariffs enacted this past week by Trump have Washington’s food and agricultural industry bracing for a trade war. The resulting plunge of stock markets has taken many retirement account balances down with them. Following Trump’s tariffs and his threats to Canadian sovereignty, border crossings from Canada to Washington state have plummeted, and in March the U.S. paused Columbia River water-sharing negotiations with Canada. Since taking office in late January, Trump has unleashed a flood of executive orders — far more than any of his recent predecessors — intent on remaking the federal government. In response, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown has joined his peers in a flurry of lawsuits trying to block the president’s agenda, leading the charge on several prominent cases. Actions affecting Washington directly that have been challenged by Brown and others include cuts to public health grants; efforts to dismantle federal agencies that support libraries, museums, workers and businesses owned by people of color; cuts to National Institutes of Health-funded programs supporting cancer research, pediatric medicine and drug development; local firings at the Department of Education; and ending the federal refugee resettlement program. Speaking to the Seattle crowd, Hamdi Mohamed, a Port of Seattle commissioner, said it’s “critical” for the U.S. to maintain a global marketplace, something Trump’s policies are making difficult. “Here in this Washington, we are trade-dependent,” Mohamed said. “I’m talking about our seafood. I’m talking about the workers that work at our docks, we feel it at the docks. I’m talking about our longshoremen that work at those docks. And I know all of you who are here today, you feel it when you go to the grocery stores.” Diane Kenny, 76, was riding the bus on her way to Seattle Center. She and her husband were meeting four friends at the protest, the first she’s attended since Trump was reelected. “The very institutions on which this country operates — economic, political — are absolutely at threat, all at the same time,” Kenny said, mentioning that she had two grandchildren who live in West Seattle. “I’ll be damned if I let them grow up in this situation.” At the Seattle rally, Sarah Johnston, a tech worker from Shoreline, carried a sign in big, bold letters that read: “They are disappearing people.” Johnston said people needed to be more aware of mass deportations and the targeting of political activists like Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University student and Palestinian activist who was arrested by federal authorities in March. “I think it’s super terrifying, and I think that’s the thing that we could get people that might not be paying attention to care about,” she said. Johnston noted that she’s a white U.S. citizen, a privilege that she and other rally attendees have and feel compelled to use. She’s not afraid for herself now, but “eventually, if I don’t say anything, I will be,” she said. As the afternoon of protests wore on, reports from outside of Seattle illustrated a broad base of discontent. Thousands of people gathered on the steps of the state Capitol g in Olympia, with protesters spilling onto the lawns and lining the main road in front of the Capitol in a turnout not seen in years. Organizers of the Olympia rally asked protesters to shout out examples of “some of the damage” done by the Trump administration. In response, they shouted back “damage to schools,” “deportations,” “trans rights” and “illegal abductions.” Protesters were also urged to call and send messages to Washington’s Democratic U.S. Sens. Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell calling for the “immediate release” of labor rights activist Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez, who was arrested by federal immigration officials and is being held at the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma. The crowd chanted “Free Lelo Juarez” for nearly a minute. Kim Piper, an Olympia resident, was there, but it was not her first protest this year. “Our democracy is a very fragile thing we could lose,” Piper said. Beckie Stephens, also an Olympia resident, was at the rally to “support the community and fight against the lack of due process that the president is not displaying.” She said her husband, and other people in her family are veterans, and her sign read “Hands off veteran benefits.” In Edmonds, travel writer and public television host Rick Steves, bullhorn in hand, led hundreds of protesters from Civic Center Park to the city’s ferry terminal. In Bothell, crowds lined Bothell Way as drivers honked in support. Bob and Kristine Kerschner, who live in Wallingford, went to the Seattle rally and carried shimmery silver signs reading “Hands off Social Security” and “Keep Medicare Safe!” The couple’s sole income comes from Social Security checks. “Those are our funds, plain and simple,” Bob Kerschner said. “They are earned. And I’m sick of this administration stealing from these programs.” The couple have been participating in regular demonstrations arguing to preserve federal programs relied upon by retired Americans, but Saturday’s demonstration was by far the largest they’d been part of. “This is bigger than Donald Trump’s inauguration,” Kerschner joked.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2024/12/19/79832605/having-an-iud-is-great-getting-one-can-be-terrible,The Stranger,Having an IUD is Great. Getting One Can Be Terrible Just Can't Get Enough?,"The appeal of the IUD is undeniable: When you can get pregnant and don’t want to, 10 baby-free years feels like a miracle, something you’d be willing to suffer for at least a little. But for a lot of patients, the pain that comes with an IUD insertion is way more than “a little.” And worse, the pain is often downplayed by providers—if it’s even addressed at all. When Rep. Amy Walen (D-48) accompanied a young woman to an insertion appointment, she found this lack of pain control horrifying. So horrifying that she’s prefiled a bill for the upcoming 2025 legislative session addressing it. House Bill 1077 would require clinicians to discuss pain management with patients before IUD insertions. Walen hopes her bill will raise awareness about the very real pain that can accompany this extremely routine procedure: IUDs are one of the most popular forms of long-acting birth control on the market. She wants to keep other people from experiencing the intense pain she witnessed in the patient she accompanied, whose pain was intense and unrelenting. “It was really, really upsetting how painful it was for her,” said Walen. With state legislatures across the country understandably focused on abortion access since the reversal of Roe v. Wade, it’s unusual to see policies like Walen’s, which specifically focus on IUDs. But maybe it shouldn’t be. If you’ve ever gotten an IUD—or talked to a fellow drunk girl in a bathroom line for just a little too long—the pain that can accompany an insertion is not new information. When I surveyed IUD users—or would-be users—about their experiences most recently, I was immediately flooded with responses describing “mind-bending pain,” prolonged failed insertion attempts, repeated uses of the word “brutal,” and comparisons to things like “a small dragon … trying to claw out of my body for 24-36 hours.” These were concerning, but they were also deeply familiar. Stories like these are the subject of casual conversations over brunch or a beer. One friend of mine described pain that lingered for days after her insertion. Another, who fainted during her appointment, attempted to put a positive spin on things: “One shining silver lining was my nurse was a hot dyke and caught me when I fell off the table and I woke up in her arms,” she said. Removal was memorably bad, too, for a former colleague of mine. “When having it extracted, my doctor (and an intern) couldn’t get it out,” she said. “He spent 30 or 45 minutes yanking on it from various angles as I tried not to scream.” My editor knows a woman whose first IUD insertion was so painful that years later, when she returned to get it replaced, she had a full-blown panic attack. Her body was so tense that they weren't able to safely complete the procedure. Even women who’ve given birth describe the pain of IUD insertion on particularly gnarly terms. Elinor Jones, better known as the celebrity gossip columnist at our sister paper the Mercury, described an insertion attempt that had to be stopped because it was so painful it was “like knives.” Annie Jurrens, who’s been through two unmedicated births, described her IUD insertion as one of “acute pain, like being stabbed in an internal organ.” Given the grim state of reproductive health care in America, stories like these—where things really devolved, but no one died or was permanently injured—might seem like minor inconveniences, hot nurse or not. And juxtaposed with the horrors visited upon people who had first-generation IUDs like the infamous Dalkon Shield, perhaps they are. A claw-like device with a sci-fi name, the Dalkon Shield’s design led so many users to develop pelvic inflammatory disease that it became the subject of one of the largest tort liability cases in history. It’s an unqualified good thing that the Dalkon Shield is off the market, but its existence seems to have set the bar in hell for future IUD experiences. You wouldn’t know this from the next-gen IUDs’ branding, ensconced in the soft focus of marketplace feminism, with imaginary girls’ names that sound like they’re written in cursive on a wooden sign inside HomeGoods: Skyla, Mirena, Kyleena. (The eminently practical ParaGard is the only exception to this: As the oldest and only non-hormonal option in the gang, the copper T is like the used Subaru hatchback of IUDs, and I mean that as the highest praise.) Despite this rosy marketing—and the very real pain they felt—the IUD users I spoke to said they received little or no advance warning that their procedures might be painful. Some were told just to take ibuprofen beforehand, others weren’t even given that advice. One was told scheduling the insertion during her period would make it easier, “but it just resulted in the whole fiasco being an absolute bloodbath,” she said. There’s a reason for this bizarro dissonance between brutal patient experiences and provider attitudes toward pain management and support: Research suggests that patients and providers perceive the pain of IUD insertion differently. A 2015 study published in The European Journal of Contraception & Reproductive Health Care found that while most IUD insertions “appeared acceptable to most patients,” providers “tended to underestimate the degree of pain experienced by their patients during IUD insertion procedures.” That could be changing. Earlier this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines for clinicians inserting IUDs to encourage conversations about pain management with patients before the speculum comes out. The CDC now recommends the use of topical or injected lidocaine, which numbs the cervix. Misoprostol, also used in medication abortions, may be helpful for some patients, but it’s not suggested for typical use. It’s not clear what role, if any, legislative policies like Walen’s will have in advancing these updated clinical guidelines, beyond drawing attention to them. Sarah Prager, an abortion provider in Seattle, was skeptical of the approach. “There already exists a lot of guidance around offering/providing pain management for IUD insertions (including newer advice from the CDC within the Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) for Contraception Use (published updates this year),” she said. “I 100% agree expanded options for pain management should be offered/available, but I disagree that legislation is the appropriate vehicle for achieving this.” But one thing is always worth remembering: A good doctor (the kind you deserve) will realize you’re in pain, and do something about it. “I was ready to power through,” said Jones. “I am grateful for my (female) doctor being like ‘You are in too much pain and I don’t recommend continuing.’” But if you’re at the doctor’s office and something is painful, you’re allowed to speak up.",,['legislation'],1.0,2025-08-03T16:16:34.582993,6780
https://www.thestranger.com/queer/2025/02/14/79922205/us-district-court-judge-blocks-trump-order-on-gender-affirming-care-says-it-would-not-survive-judicial-scrutiny,The Stranger,"US District Court Judge Blocks Trump Order on Gender Affirming Care, Says It Would Not “Survive Judicial Scrutiny” Just Can't Get Enough?","US District Court Judge Lauren King today temporarily blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order to withhold all federal funding for gender-affirming care for people under age 19 from taking effect in Washington, Oregon and Minnesota—the three states that filed suit against the Trump administration last week. The order is blocked for the next 14 days. King, a Biden appointee, said Trump’s executive order intended to erase transgender people and “blatantly discriminated against trans youth.” The decision came less than 24 hours after a judge in Maryland temporarily blocked the order nationwide. King believed that Trump’s executive order—titled “Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation”— was not likely to “survive judicial scrutiny” because it subverted the power of Congress to distribute money for potentially lifesaving gender-affirming care and violated equal protection under the 5th Amendment by not funding trans health care, while continuing to fund the same, or similar treatments, for cisgender children. Judge King’s temporary restraining order comes exactly one week after Washington Attorney General Nick Brown sued over Trump’s order. As AG Brown said at a news conference announcing the suit, the order not only threatened to defund hospitals and research institutions that provided this care, but possibly prosecute providers. Transgender people across the country have lost care because doctors and hospitals took those threats seriously, including Seattle Children’s Hospital, which last week postponed a trans teen’s masculinizing top surgery the night before it was scheduled, attracting protest from trans people, parents of trans kids, and their supporters. During the hearing, Washington Deputy Solicitor General Tera Heintz argued Trump’s order was “open and unapologetic bigotry” that rejected the overwhelming medical consensus that gender-affirming care is safe and effective for children. She read comments from a plaintiff in the case, a doctor who has treated hundreds of trans children, and remains anonymous for fear of retribution.“There are going to be young people who take their lives if they can no longer receive this care,” she read. “Without access to this care, transgender adolescents will die—I am certain of it.” Heintz said the states’ lawyers had introduced a mound of evidence showing how gender-affirming care, introduced in slow and deliberate stages, drastically improved children’s lives, Heintz said. Heintz also said that this order reads as an implict threat to providers because it equates all trans care to “chemical and surgical mutilation,” and asks the Department of Justice to review and prioritize laws against female genital mutilation, or the cutting, sewing, or removal of the labia or clitoris for non-medical reasons. Now it was the government’s burden to prove, with evidence, that it is the mutilation it claims it is. It could not. The government’s lawyer, Vinita Andrapalliyal, argued the President had the constitutional authority to direct his agency heads to take appropriate next steps on a “policy preference.” It is possible the order “could be implemented lawfully,” she said, and until an agency revoked any grant, the court did not have to decide, and should wait to see how this “shakes out.” Her argument fell apart a few minutes later when Judge King started asking simple questions, like: Were all the treatments as “irreversible” as the order claimed they were? “No, I don’t think we specifically say one way or the other—” Vinita Andrapalliyal said. “I’m asking you today,” King interjected. “I don’t—I don’t know, I’m here today—” “You have not looked into it.” “I’m here within the lawfulness of the executive order—” “This is part of it,” King said. “Do you have any evidence that all of the treatments listed in the executive order are irreversible?” Andrapalliyal said she had evidence of the President’s policy prerogative to not fund the “so-called transition of a child from one sex to another.” “But we’re looking at goals here—irreversible treatment is central to the goals. You haven’t looked into that at all. You don’t have an answer for me today.” This carried on for 13 more excruciating minutes. When King asked for an example of the order targeting similar treatment for cisgender people, there was a thirty second pause. When King asked if the government would allow doctors to prescribe puberty blockers, a drug given to both cisgender and transgender children to delay the onset of puberty, to a cisgender boy with prostate cancer, while disallowing doctors from giving the same medication to a transgender girl with the same condition, there was another long pause. After disagreement about the meaning of the text, Andrapalliyal reiterated that the President is asking his agencies to take next steps consistent with the law, and they don’t yet know those steps. King posed another hypothetical: A recently married, 18-year-old cisgender man with Huntington’s Disease gets a vasectomy because he does not want to pass it onto his children. Was that included in the government’s refusal to support the alteration or removal of an individual’s sex organs to “minimize or destroy their natural biological functions?” “I don’t know,” Andrapalliyal said. “Can you read the text and let me know what you think?” King asked. Another pause, which like the others, was filled with snickering from an obviously queer audience. (Before the hearing, activists had circulated a flier encouraging people to “pack the court.” At 9:20, forty minutes before the hearing, the line for security nearly snaked out the door. Every seat was taken, even in the overflow room.) “I’m not a medical provider,” Andrapalliyal said. “If you can’t figure it out—how is a medical provider supposed to know that?” King said. “This is not a medical text. This is an executive order.” After back and forth of when and how medical providers were supposed to determine a person’s birth sex, for which Andrapalliyal had no answers, she said there were a lot of unknowns. “Medical providers have no direction on where to go because you can’t read the text and apply it to various facts,” King said, sharply exhaling. “This is extremely frustrating, counsel.” At courthouse steps, a reporter asked AG Brown what he thought of this exchange. “A bit embarrassing,” he said to laughter and applause, but he later turned serious. “I want to remind people that the Department of Justice was created to defend civil rights,” he said. “What we’re seeing from this President is a specific undermining of its purpose, a specific directive to no longer defend civil rights, and it is upsetting to me, personally and professionally.” Indigo, a nonbinary person who responded to the activist call to “pack the court,” said it was important to show up in numbers to support the community, even just to be a “body in a room.” They’re also Asian-American, and went through the “whole China virus thing” during COVID-19, so they knew how Trump’s comments could galvanize people with bigoted views to take violent action. Standing in the courtyard outside, Danni Askini, executive director of the Seattle-based trans advocacy organization Gender Justice League, wondered if the “shock and awe” effect of the Trump Administration is their “own undoing.” “They’ve pushed so much stuff down on the Department of Justice, and they’re firing people left and right,” she says. “Who wants to work in a politicized law firm like the DOJ as it is now? I really feel for the Assistant US Attorney who argued the case.” After all, the DOJ essentially failed to make the same case twice this week. On Thursday, US District Judge Brendan Hurson of Maryland also issued a temporary restraining order blocking Trump’s order. During the hearing, Hurson said he was skeptical that the government’s order was not effectively banning care nationwide by threatening to pull funding from hospitals and research institutions that provide or study transgender care for youth and young adults. Patients had received phone calls stopping care, stopping their appointments, stopping their “everything,” he said. “I don’t know how you can credibly argue that this is not demanding the cessation of funding for gender affirming care.” Whether or not hospitals needed to comply with Trump’s order in the first place is unclear. Executive orders are not laws. They’re directives to federal agencies. As of today, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Department of Health and Human Services has not issued a new rule on trans care. Even if it had, any policy change would be subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. The rule would undergo public comment. Implementation should take months if not years. However, the Trump administration has a, let’s say, creative approach to current law and administrative procedure. During today’s hearing, Heintz told Judge King that at least one recipient of a federal grant at the University of Washington received a five sentence notice from Health and Human Services that told them to terminate any program in conflict with the executive order. King remarked that the title of the email indicated it was likely sent to all recipients of those grants. President2 Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance have openly questioned the judiciary’s authority over the executive branch. We don’t know what those Yankees teach over at their fancy-schmancy Yale Law School, but that is very much the point of the courts. But Vance is not one to let knowledge get in the way of power. Seattle Children’s filed a declaration in support of Brown’s lawsuit, where Jeffrey J. Ojemann, the hospital’s senior vice president and chief physician executive, argued that losing federal funds would be cataclysmic. He explained the hospital’s research program employs more than 375 faculty investigators, and 100 postdoctoral scholars, who study every “aspect of pediatric health and disease,” including childhood cancer and blood disorders, immunotherapy, infectious diseases, neurological disorders and respiratory diseases. Research takes money, a lot of it federal funds: In 2024, the hospital was awarded nearly $185 million in federal research grants. According to a lawyer from the ACLU, Hurson’s decision should give hospitals like Children’s the confidence to care for their patients without risking their funding. AG Brown reiterated that point today. “I want to encourage all of the providers in this state, in the state of Oregon and the state of Minnesota to get back to work,” he said. It appears that’s already happening. After the hearing, The Stranger checked in with Sarah, the mother of the trans teen whose top surgery Children’s postponed last week. She’d just gotten a call from the hospital to reschedule her son’s surgery. Children’s did not confirm if it had resumed all forms of gender-affirming care, but thanked AG Brown for filing the complaint “so that Seattle Children’s has the clarity needed at this time to deliver on our mission while ensuring we operate within all applicable laws.” Temporary restraining orders are just that. Temporary. The state will likely seek a preliminary-injunction, an order that will last longer than 14 days.",,['policy'],1.0,2025-08-03T16:16:34.581998,11229

His family, with the help of national advocates including the Gabby Petito Foundation, is determined to bring him home safely. PREVIOUS COVERAGE | 1st possible sighting of missing man with autism in Kirkland renews hope for family ""We need help finding Jonathan, and we can’t do it by ourselves,"" said Thao Hoang, Jonathan's father. More than 120 days have passed since Jonathan vanished from his family's home, with no trace of him found save for a brief sighting in late June. Surveillance footage from multiple neighbors on the night of June 23 showed a young man resembling Hoang in the South Juanita area near 105th Avenue Northeast and Northeast 112th Street. His family continues to search for answers. ""We’re just wondering what happened. He appeared and then disappeared, and we’re feeling a little frantic right now,"" said Ann Hoang, Jonathan's mother. The ""Honk and Wave"" rally, held at the corner of Broadway and Hewitt in Everett, aimed to raise awareness of Jonathan's disappearance and demonstrate community unity. National groups like the Gabby Petito Foundation and 'Light the Way' joined local volunteers to spread awareness. ""It was a godsend when they contacted us and said 'Hey, we would like to help you,' and it was such a big relief for us because, like Ann said, we were desperate. It felt like we were alone,"" Thao said. Community members have also reached out to offer assistance. ""People reach out to us and ask how can we help find Jonathan and bringing awareness is really the key,"" Thao added. Jonathan, who is autistic and verbal but considered vulnerable, was last credibly sighted just over a month ago on a home security camera in Kirkland. His family believes he is still alive and in need of help. Family and supporting organizations have also stated they believe Jonathan was most likely coerced or taken from his home.

https://www.thestranger.com/music/2025/07/24/80164047/thing-festival-cancels-one-weekend-due-to-ice-concerns,The Stranger,Thing Festival Cancels One Weekend Due to ICE Concerns Just Can't Get Enough?,"Earlier today, the THING Festival announced via social media that it had “made the very difficult decision” to cancel its August 16 date, which had been “specially curated to showcase some of music’s most exceptional Latinx and Spanish-language artists.” The statement read, “Community safety concerns have greatly reduced ticket sales, and the uncertainty about artists’ ability to secure the necessary visas has led to our decision. We stand with our broader community and remain committed to prioritizing attendee and artist safety, and to ensure our events are a positive and memorable arts experience. We want to sincerely thank the artists, our community partners and sponsors, and everyone behind the scenes who worked tirelessly to bring this unique event to life.” The organization also noted that all August 16 ticket holders should expect to see refunds returned to their original forms of payment within the next seven to 10 business days. THING was founded in 2019 and has traditionally been a three-day-long festival in the past, but this year, the organization opted for a new format with a series of events set to take place at Remlinger Farms in Carnation, Washington across four weekends in August. Chilean-Mexican pop singer Mon Laferte was slated to headline the August 16 lineup, along with Yahritza y Su Esencia, Thee Sinseers, Rubén Albarrán, Angélica Garcia, Terror/Cactus and Pahua, and Lucia Flors-Wiseman. The festival isn’t the first event to be called off recently under similar circumstances. In June, the Duwamish River Community Coalition canceled the Duwamish River Festival in the South Park neighborhood due to speculation that ICE might target it, and earlier this month, the Burien nonprofit Joyas Mestizas announced that they would cancel the 2025 Pacific Northwest Folklórico Festival, writing, “We are angry at the ICE raids and racist immigration policies that tear families apart, and in canceling our event we commit to prioritizing the safety of our community. As a community organization born from the 20th-century freedom movements, Joyas Mestizas not only understands the arts as essential to pushing against oppression but recognizes folklorico’s continued existence as a testament to our coming together. While we stand firm in our origins, the urgency of our community’s need for safety and security demands immediate action.” Just earlier this week, Fernando Rocha, the theater manager at Juanita High School was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. KUOW reported last week that King County passed a resolution on Tuesday, July 15, that would support protections for immigrants and prevent county agencies from sharing sensitive data that could lead to immigrant enforcement. We’ve reached out to THING Festival’s organizers for comment and will update this article if we hear back. As always, fuck ICE.",,[],0.0,2025-08-03T16:16:34.590636,2869

Deputies responded to the scene on July 30 around 6 a.m. to find the vehicle abandoned in the parking lot. According to surveillance footage, the maroon car had been parked at a nearby AutoZone since the previous day. The driver had informed employees that the vehicle was not functioning properly and that he would return to tow it. At approximately 3:45 a.m., a white Honda Pilot with a dolly attempted to tow the maroon car. The vehicle was initially pulled from its parking spot around 5:15 a.m., but the tow strap failed, leaving it at the far end of the parking lot. A second attempt to secure the vehicle around 5:50 a.m. resulted in the vehicle rolling down the lot and crashing into the restaurant. The Honda driver made a third attempt to tow the vehicle, but the strap broke again, causing the car to crash into the restaurant a second time. Ultimately, the driver and a female passenger abandoned the maroon car after it became stuck along a retention wall and curb.

The Kraken were in Anchorage for their annual partnership trip with the Bristol Bay Native Corporation, a union that brings a blend of hockey and community engagement to hockey fans in Alaska. RELATED | Seattle Kraken in the news - matches, players, and more The week-long event included a hockey camp hosted by the Anchorage Hockey Academy. The camp featured Kraken forward John Hayden, the team's mascot Buoy, and various youth hockey coaches from the Kraken organization. However, during a fly fishing excursion on June 25 in Katmai National Park, an uninvited guest showed up - a grizzly bear. Video provided by Kraken shows the bear watching the fisherpeople from the other side of the shallow river. As its presence is flagged and everyone begins to quickly evacuate the water, the bear is seen advancing on them, rushing toward the group and sending spray flying before veering away again. It seemed particularly interested in the blue-haired Buouy, who, ever the good sport, never stopped smiling as he slogged away to safety. ""I want to blame it on Buoy. They were pretty interested in his whole look. We got out of it okay, but it was a close call,"" Hayden said. During the trip, the Kraken visited their 2025 Make-A-Wish recipient, Caleb, and his family. The team revealed that Caleb and his family would be traveling to Seattle for a game and a special Kraken experience in January. The Seattle Kraken have partnered with the Bristol Bay Native Corporation for the past four years, focusing on growing youth hockey in Alaska and promoting sustainability goals in the Pacific Northwest region and beyond.",,[],0.0,2025-08-03T16:17:45.696234,1935
