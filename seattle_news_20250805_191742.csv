We’re taking over the city. Choose your fighter. We know it’s easy to miss these odd year elections. They’re local! They’re wonky! There’s not a President in sight. Maybe you’ve used up all your fucks and your will to live watching the world sputter and burn. Or maybe you spent them watching our city government waste everyone’s time building digital advertising kiosks, painting over graffiti, trying to weaken our ethics code, and allowing cops the ability to lob blastballs into protests once again instead of finding ways to protect us from a robber baron and literal fascists. But please vote. Please please please. This year, we have the chance to swap big business politicians for scrappy progressives across the ballot. (Sara Nelson is up for reelection. Need we say more?) And if we seize the opportunity, we can also maintain the proud Seattle tradition of one-term mayors. In just a few months, we could say goodbye to the mayor who couldn’t even keep the one promise he cared about (bringing back the Seattle SuperSonics). The mayor who never managed to find a vision for Seattle’s future, because he was busy sweeping the homeless people out of downtown and into Little Saigon. But you’ll never see him holding the broom—because he’s unable to lift a finger, let alone take responsibility for this city. Seattle has rarely—if ever—allowed itself the luxury of having a progressive mayor and a progressive city council at the same time, because we’re masochists who get our rocks off at complaining about the Seattle Process. Right now, this city is currently run by vampires. Let’s take a bath in free-range fair-trade certified organic holy water and fashion a stake from lab-grown (or ethically sourced) balsa wood and get out there. This year, dare we say it, there’s a roster of honest-to-goodness actual progressives that are looking for a chance to totally transform Seattle. And they couldn’t have come at a better time. We’re staring down the pike of a Seattle comprehensive plan that will steer the next two decades of growth and infrastructure on these near-suburban streets. We’ve got a lot of work to do if we don’t want the Seattle of the future to be a charming little hamlet with $4,000-per-square-foot rents, nary a corner store in sight, and unionized robocops arresting “the nipple” at the behest of an anti-socialist neural network that’s named itself Jeff Bezos 2. So listen up, we’re choosing our mayor, our city attorney, our county executive, and three city council seats—and that’s not even the whole ballot. In the last month, we sat down with (almost) all of the candidates. They made their case. They brought us snacks that sometimes we were allergic to. Nobody even cried this year, but they screamed a lot. Idiot aside, we heard a lot of exciting ideas from inspiring people politicians. Uh oh, is our optimism showing? We hate when that happens. But if the best of the best get elected, we’ll go full frontal. Because right now we simply cannot resist the potential dripping from these ballots. Let’s fantasize for a sec: City Council District 2 is going to have a new champion. Pro-business, anti-protester (evil) Council President Sara Nelson has a real challenger in Dionne Foster. And we’re pouring our hope into Katie Wilson to once and for all send Bruce Harrell packing. You should get your ballot around July 18. If you don’t know what to do with it, we have a guide on page 20. Let’s go. We’ve got a city to fix. City of Seattle MayorKatie Wilson Bruce Harrell had his chance. A lifetime ago (in 2021), when Harrell first ran for mayor, he made a lot of big, substantive promises that voters seemed to believe: He pledged to build 1,000 new housing units in his first six months in office; he committed to changing the biased policing culture in SPD after the George Floyd protests; he said he didn’t believe “dispersal,” or sweeps, worked, and promised to take a “Housing First” approach to encampments around the city. Are we living in a utopia yet? In our endorsement meeting, we asked about his broken promises. We pointed out that he conducted more sweeps than his five predecessors combined. That he sunk years of municipal effort and energy into a Comprehensive Plan that won’t meet our housing needs. That he pandered to police with bruised egos, letting them become the militant thugs that we saw in Cal Anderson on Memorial Day weekend, but with higher salaries. And in an hour-long endorsement meeting, he didn’t answer for a single thing. In every case, the conditions in his city were someone else’s fault. Homelessness? The other cities in King County aren’t doing their part. The police that he says can take a hike if they don’t agree with his idea of good policing? Well, he told us, he doesn’t actually know what good policing is. They’re the experts, not him. Nothing was his responsibility. We understand why he would feel that way. Because the greatest sin of the Harrell Administration is what it hasn’t done. He’s a mayor without imagination, and with him at the helm, Seattle is a rudderless ship on a windless ocean. While tens of thousands of Seattleites are struggling to keep their head above water, he’s obsessing over penises spray painted on the overpasses, AI incubators, and digital advertising kiosks that profit private companies. There’s a perception that this race was Harrell’s from the start, so there was no use doing anything to stop him. But that’s not the case. In polling this spring, only 37 percent of Seattleites were happy with Harrell’s work in City Hall. Enough of Seattle is sick of the Harrell Show. Katie Wilson is Harrell’s opposite. If Harrell is all politics and no substance, Wilson is substance embodied. She’s been an organizer in Seattle for 15 years, and she’s built a career fighting for—and winning—campaigns like raising the minimum wage, protecting affordable transit, and building progressive revenue. Wilson’s campaign platform is clearly made by someone who’s used to making change in a system that’s built to fight against it. She has clear, step-by-step plans to build 4,000 units of shelter in four years, to streamline access to addiction and mental health treatment, and to build $1 billion worth of union-built affordable housing. Harrell made promises. Wilson actually intends to keep hers. And she knows how to do it. In our meeting, one question best captured the difference between Wilson and Harrell. We asked about the FIFA World Cup coming to Seattle in 2026. When Seattle hosted the MLB All-Star game in 2023, the city swept any encampments in the area out of sight. Surely, next year, Seattle’s mayor would have to field a fair amount of outside pressure to make visible homelessness invisible while the world’s eyes are on us. How would they respond? We gave Harrell two chances to answer the question, and he never did. Instead, he ranted about how our surrounding cities aren’t building as much shelter as we are, how he has to prioritize small businesses, said it was his responsibility to revitalize downtown, and reminded us that he signed an ordinance to make Seattle a Human Rights City. Then he turned to the other candidates, and said: “How dare you talk about the values I’ve been a part of for the last 16 years.” Wilson, meanwhile, rejected the premise of the question entirely. Not because she didn’t want to answer it, but because she had a plan to stand up enough shelter in the first six months of her term—between tiny home villages, faith communities, and vacancies throughout the city—to make the question irrelevant. “Let’s get people inside in time for the World Cup,” she said. See that, Harrell? No excuses, just a goal, a plan, and a timeline. This is why Wilson has our vote. She sees people that are struggling and thinks about solutions, not optics. She obviously, palpably gives a damn about people, and that drives her to act, not just talk. While we were writing this endorsement, Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist with a people-first platform, wiped the floor with an establishment Democrat in New York City’s primary. Mamdani’s win is proof that people can show up in droves and throw decades of political tradition in the trash and choose something better. And that to accomplish such a feat, being a hell of a politician with a great personality helps a fuckton. Wilson has the platform. What she doesn’t have is the energy. She’s quiet. She’s policy minded. She makes deeply awkward TikToks. But she knows her shit and she cares. Wilson doesn’t pull out the tear-jerking stump speech or throw down with her opposition. And while we trust that your vote will get her through the primary, we need her to throw down. Show everyone that Harrell’s empty, that he’s unelectable this time. This city wants to see that. And it wants change. Do what you need to do to give the people what they want. Show us your spine is as sturdy as that platform. We know it’s in you. Now reader, we know that Wilson isn’t the only one making a run for Harrell’s graffiti-less office (and Joe Molloy, we hope to see you run for City Council, where your good heart, and brains, would be appreciated), but she’s the only one who has the secret sauce we need to see: one-part great ideas, one-part the knowledge and experience to pull them off, two-parts the willingness to leave an easier life as an organizer to serve the city when she thinks she’s needed. We just need her to add a little heat to that sauce. If you’re still wondering if dethroning Harrell is the right decision, we’ll leave you with one more detail. For the last year, members of his administration have talked about the misogyny, bullying, and literal chest beating in City Hall since he’s been in office. We had Mayor Harrell in our conference room for just under an hour, and in that time, he did nothing to convince us that his reputation was not a completely accurate characterization. We lost count of how many times he pounded his fist onto the table and stomped his feet, and we had to shout over him more than once to stop him from yelling at other candidates. Harrell somehow made Joe Mallahan look good (well, not that good). He took control of the room—not the way a charismatic speaker captures an audience, but the way your angry uncle sucks the air out of the room on Thanksgiving. Our civic self-esteem cannot be so low. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that we need a strong, bullish personality at the helm of our city to combat everything that Trump promises to rain on us in the next three and a half years. Mayor Harrell has shown us, time and time again, that all he’s going to do is bully Seattle, not Trump. And we can’t afford that. Wilson may be quiet. But she has values. Seattle has a time-honored tradition of producing one-term mayors. Let’s make Harrell one of them. Vote Wilson. City AttorneyErika Evans In case you’ve been living under a rock for the last three-and-a-half years, let us brief you on our current City Attorney: the regrettable Republican Ann Davison. The City Attorney has two jobs: one criminal (prosecuting all of the city’s misdemeanor cases, like DUIs and domestic violence charges) and one civil (acting as the city’s attorney, either suing people or other governments and also defending Seattle in court when, for instance, the Seattle Chamber of Commerce sues the city to kill the JumpStart tax). From a criminal perspective, Davison’s whole thing is being “tough on crime,” which famously does nothing to make our city safer or to get people on the streets the help they need. She instituted policies like Close-in-Time filing. Implemented in 2022, it’s meant to reduce the criminal case backlog, but really just places the backlog in a different pile. It hasn’t worked. Her “High Utilizer Initiative” to target frequent offenders, surprise, also doesn’t solve any problems and worsens recidivism. Plus, Davison killed “community court,” an alternative system that offers people charged with misdemeanors non-punitive options to resolve their cases. Meanwhile, Davison is unforgivably behind on filing DUI cases—one of the two serious misdemeanors the office can prosecute. Domestic violence cases are lagging. Back in 2021, before Davison, it took 26 days to file a DV case. Last year, on average, it took twice as long. Davison is a tumor on the city and we don’t expect her to be willing to stand up to Trump. She converted to the Republican party during DJT’s first term, when anyone with an ounce of sense jumped ship. When King County, San Francisco, Santa Clara County, Portland, and New Haven signed onto a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security for their attacks on “sanctuary jurisdictions,” Davison dragged her feet, only joining the lawsuit months later. Meanwhile, while Boston and 43 other cities (including our less progressive neighbors, Spokane and Olympia) fought cuts to federal research funding, Davison stayed out of it. This person cannot protect us from the next three-and-a-half years (or more) of authoritarian encroachment. So, she sucks. We can’t let her win again. And she could. With three progressive challengers splitting the left vote, Davison will almost certainly skate through the primary, liberal Seattle bubble be damned. The people who didn’t march in the No Kings rally get ballots, too! Of this bunch, we believe Erika Evans, a former assistant US Attorney, is our choice to best Ann, make the City Attorney’s office effective and fair, and protect Seattle from the Trump administration. Evans has prosecuted hate crimes, she’s gone after drug traffickers, she’s slapped the wrists of business owners dipping into their employees’ wages, and she was involved in a case prosecuting January 6ers from Puyallup. Her résumé is impressive. Her platform (speed up DUI and DV case filings, bring back community court, prosecute wage theft, improve the police union contract to allow for more policing alternatives) mirrors the platforms of her opponents. But they don’t have her grit. In our meeting, Evans leapt for her opponents’ throats. She presented exhibits for every argument, and demonstrated a deep understanding of the power, and limitations, of the City Attorney’s Office. She spoke thoughtfully about the importance of working closely with Washington Attorney General Nick Brown against the constitutionally intolerant Trump administration, and made a commitment to not prosecute “peaceful” protesters (though she wouldn’t define a “peaceful protester” for us, which is peak prosecutor brain). We also love a prop comedian: she brought Jarritos and African Black soap to symbolize SOAP/SODA laws, a Raggedy Ann doll to represent Davison, a printout of photos of the white men who have held this office for the 150 years before Ann got the job, a binder of her and her opponents case files. Sure, she gave Model-UN vibes, and if being corny were illegal this woman would be in jail. But it isn’t. And what we care about is Evans’s ability and will to protect us when Trump goes after this city. We know, we know. A history as a prosecutor brings with it a track record of upholding a system built for oppression. But our federal government is actively antagonistic to cities like ours, and a prosecutor knows how the federal government works. Evans knows what levers to pull. And local progressives such as City Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck and State Rep. Shaun Scott believe she’s the right choice despite all the prosecutorial baggage. But we don’t discount her mistakes and our misgivings. Evans voted for Bruce Harrell last election (“But I voted for Nikkita Oliver twice when they ran,” Evans said). She donated $100 to Harrell’s campaign before Katie Wilson got into the race, but wouldn’t say whom she was voting for in this election, and hedged by saying she couldn’t talk shit when the winner could be her client. Public defenders are worried about what her real intentions are and how she’ll act when she’s in the seat of power. We understand where they’re coming from. But we’re inviting her to prove them wrong. This wasn’t an easy decision. Any of Davison’s challengers would be wildly better for Seattle. We wish we could have endorsed Nathan Rouse, the public defender running for the seat, because he knows the system doesn’t work for everyday people and wants to change it. He’s tougher on the Seattle Police Officers Guild than any other candidates. But he didn’t convince us he could put his ideas into action or win. Please run again next time, Nathan. We want to see you in our swivel chairs again, with more experience under your belt. Thanks for the Pop-Tarts. And Rory O’Sullivan could do a perfectly fine job in the role. But he lacks trial experience. And most importantly, we aren’t confident he could beat Davison. Evans will hit the ground running in a way we need. Here’s to knocking Davison into the stratosphere. Vote Evans. City Council, District No. 2Eddie Lin We didn’t know what kind of fresh hell we were in for when District 2 City Councilmember Tammy Morales bowed out of office one year into her second term. The appointment process sucked; the unimaginative snoozers on the city council selected multiple-SECB-endorsement-loser Mark Solomon to take the seat. Luckily, Solomon isn’t running to keep the seat, so we have an open race on our hands! Which brings us to the pool of four viable D2 hopefuls: Union guy and SDCI inspector Jamie Fackler; restaurant organizer and activist Jeanie Chunn; assistant city attorney Eddie Lin; and mayoral transportation engagement manager Adonis Ducksworth. After a lively (read: tense, yell-y) discussion, the clear choice for D2 is Eddie Lin. As an assistant city attorney, Lin’s focus for the last several years has been working with the Office of Housing. When it comes to housing, and building more of it, Lin knows his stuff. In the midst of a never-ending housing crisis and a new Social Housing Developer on its way through the Seattle Process’s long birth canal, we need someone who can get shit done. Lin knows we need subsidized affordable units, social housing, limited equity co-ops, and everything else under the sun to get people four walls and a roof. Plus, whoever sits on council will implement Mayor Bruce Harrell’s Comprehensive Plan. Lin, a fiend for density and walkable neighborhoods, is a smart choice to kickstart the next 20 years of Seattle’s growth. One of the main hits against Lin, as Fackler repeatedly brought up, was that he didn’t go all out championing Proposition 1A, the voter measure that set up a funding mechanism for the Social Housing Developer. Lin didn't vote for it because, as a housing wonk, he was concerned that it was vulnerable to being undermined by a more conservative, Chamber-backed City Council. However, he says he’s come around and is ready to champion it. He’s also a total slut (sorry, Eddie) for progressive revenue. He’s DFAIT (Down For An Income Tax), a vacancy tax, and a city-level capital gains tax. We liked Chunn’s idea for a commercial vacancy tax, but felt she was still a little too green to hack it in City Hall. We hope to see her again. The other knock against Lin is, like all other candidates except Chunn, he wants more cops. Lin’s desire for increased police presence does go hand-in-hand with hiring a more diverse police force and expanding police alternatives. Plus, Lin’s experience with police brutality made him wary of cops. In his 20s, a Minneapolis police officer cuffed him, put his hands on his throat, and made racist comments—confusing Lin, who is Asian, for a Native American. The rattling experience forever changed Lin’s view of policing. We felt Fackler, while progressive and knowledgeable about the same issues, was too soft on the cops, especially their union. We’re certain Ducksworth will win the Seattle Times endorsement. He’s suave, charming, and doesn’t answer a single question. He’s also fucking cool. Sadly, underneath his skater chic, Ducksworth is nothing but a visionless moderate (read: Bruce Harrell). We already doubted he’d be our guy from the start, and he did us a solid by confirming that with a shitty, uninformed comment blaming drug users for their own predicament. “I did the ride along last week, and these guys asked at least 50 people, are they ready to go to treatment? We got one. We got one. So this comes down to the person on the street, too. Who wants to get off the street,” Ducksworth said. “That’s because some of the treatment options are not—,” Lin said. “They’re not asking about the treatment options,” Ducksworth interrupted. “They’re getting high.” Ducksworth’s mask came off. We did not like it under there. So, Lin is our guy. He’s the whole package. He’s a cat guy and a dog guy. He’s a public schools champion. This is why we willfully turned a blind eye to the fact that he could only name two examples when asked what his four favorite films were and one of them was White Lotus Season 1, famously not a movie. If he’s even seen a movie, he wasn’t paying attention. There weren’t enough housing solutions for his taste. Vote Lin. City Council, Position No. 8Alexis Mercedes Rinck When we endorsed Alexis Mercedes Rinck in 2024, we had a lot to say about what she wouldn’t do: She wouldn’t stoop to a lower minimum wage, she wouldn’t make it easier for landlords to evict you, she wouldn’t reduce oversight on cops, she wouldn’t help corporations hoard more wealth. That was because we knew that if she was elected, she (and at the time, Tammy Morales before she was bullied out of City Hall) would be a progressive in a sea of conservatism. As we hoped, she pushed back: She voted against giving SPD more access to “less lethal” weapons, and when her colleagues approved additional surveillance from law enforcement, she opposed it. But more important than what she didn’t do is what she did. Despite being on council with people allergic to helping the city, Rinck found other ways to show up. She supported counterprotesters at a Christian Supremacist group in Cal Anderson, and was instrumental in convincing the city to deescalate the situation. She spoke out at the committee hearing when Council Member Cathy Moore tried to defang our city’s ethics code, even though she wasn’t on that committee (and even though Council President Sara Nelson tried desperately to shut her up). Rinck knows that being on city council gives her a voice, and she’s shown us over and over again that she’s willing to use it for ordinary people. She’s also clearly the voice we need to start fixing our ass-backward revenue streams in Seattle. Just weeks after our endorsement interview, she presented a collaborative effort with the mayor to reform our tax code to reduce the taxes that small businesses are paying, shift the burden to big business, and raise an extra $90 million in the process. Now that’s what we call progressive revenue! Rinck doesn’t have much competition in this race. Her standout opponent is Rachael Savage, who quite frankly fascinates us, even if we had to sage the office after she left. A Republican with chunky jewelry and overlined lipstick who started the election season running for mayor, Savage switched to a City Council race just before the filing deadline. She owns a new-age shop on Capitol Hill, runs a meditation program, and believes that her experience getting sober justifies her argument that people who are mentally ill or dealing with “late-stage” addiction should be shipped to facilities for Shiny Happy People outside of the city. Oh, and she told us words are never violent and hate speech doesn’t exist. This election has the chance to reshape our city council into a functioning governing body (would we even recognize it?) and we want to see what Rinck can do when she’s not swimming upstream. Vote Rinck. City Council, Position No. 9Dionne Foster Seattle will not have a functional city government until Sara Nelson is KO’d so far out of our political orbit that she’ll be nothing more than a footnote: a forgettable, one-time City Council President who reigned over this legislative body during a remarkably chaotic and useless time in its history. At this point, progressives would endorse a cinder block over Nelson if it had a pulse and a fixed Seattle address. Fortunately, we don’t have to. Because we have Dionne Foster, an excellent candidate for this office. Rejoice! Foster, a former policy advisor for the city and the former executive director of the nonprofit Washington Progress Alliance, is a knowledgeable, likable, competent wonk. She wants to lead the way on economic justice. Stop this city’s affordability crisis and addiction to sweeps from displacing people. She’ll fight conservatives on this council willing to divert JumpStart funds from affordable housing. Unlike Nelson, Foster knows Seattle must go harder for housing density than the legal minimum set by the state and that it’s unrealistic for a real city expecting major growth in the next two decades to click its ruby red heels, ignore its housing needs, and remain an overgrown, dysfunctional suburb forever. Foster also wants to embrace affordability and outrun Washington’s regressive tax code with progressive revenue. She wants a municipal capital gains tax, a vacancy tax, and working with the state on a mansion tax. She has the right plans and can articulate exactly how she’d implement them, a rare quality on our curb-busting city council. She’s granular, but not myopic. And we believe her because she already did this work at the state level to pass the limited capital gains tax Foster has earned a heap of endorsements from politicians like Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, State Rep. Shaun Scott (D-43), and Scott’s dearly departed predecessor, Frank Chopp, because she is the best, quickest-witted candidate to walk through our door this election cycle. With two other seats up for reelection, that’s a chance she won’t be a progressive island on council. Nelson, on the other hand, is a fundamentally un-democratic chaos agent and a disastrous leader whose sole purpose has been to accumulate political power. Her Council’s “accomplishments” have been wildly unpopular: Approving a police contract with big raises and no accountability? Putting blast balls back in the hands of untrustworthy cops, and ensuring they can surveil us? Establishing “stay out” zones for drug users and sex workers that stigmatize people and don’t work? Attempting to weaken our ethics code and repeal protections for gig workers? We’re embarrassed. Seattle is immobilized in Nelson’s… full Nelson, controlled by business interests who shelled out hundreds of thousands of dollars for her meandering status quo that squeezes the renters, the poor, the homeless, and the disadvantaged on the margins. A skilled politician at least pretends to listen. Nelson is either incapable or indifferent. She shuts down anyone who is too loud and cumbersome for her taste. Her hostility for representative government and working people is boundless. But in her hallowed chambers at least we’ll have decorum, won’t we? Her contempt for the public seemed like the only reason competitor Connor Nash, a former state and federal employee, joined this race. Mia Jacobsen, on the other hand, is running a protest campaign to overhaul the system that puts people like Nelson in the driver’s seat. Nash was angry, shooed away too many times. But Nelson isn’t just the rock and the hard place. She’s a liability. A threat to reforms from a more progressive council, a roadblock to desperately needed progress on housing and homelessness, and the last person we want in city government when President Donald Trump comes to play. We’re tired of incompetence. We want someone with ideas, who loves this city and its people. A vote for Nelson is a vote for nihilism. A vote for Foster is a vote for intelligence, compassion, solutions, and a chance for a future. Vote Foster. Proposition No. 1Vote Yes If you’re registered to vote in Seattle, you’ve probably had a chance to see the Democracy Voucher Program (DVP) in action: a blue and white envelope arrives in your mailbox with a small stack of $25 coupons; you, the voter, are invited to spend them on any candidate you like. It’s Seattle’s own, first-in-the-nation public campaign financing program. And Proposition 1 asks if we want to renew the levy that funds it for another decade. The new levy would be funded through a property tax, and it’s expected to raise $45 million over 10 years, costing the average homeowner $12.20 a year. By most metrics, the DVP has been a roaring success. It makes primaries more competitive and campaigning accessible to more diverse candidates, and the vast majority of people running for office in Seattle participate in the program. More than 106,000 Seattleites have slipped their vouchers to candidates, and according to the City, through 2024, we’ve distributed more than $10 million to local campaigns. It’s difficult to find opponents to the DVP (the opposition statement is written by right-wing radio host Ari Hoffman). But supporters of the program still have complaints. The most common concern is that when we introduced the Democracy Voucher Program (which limits the amount of money a candidate can accept), spending from lobbyists skyrocketed (which remained unlimited). But lobbying spending has shot up across the region, not just here in Seattle. And even if it did push lobbyists to up their game, it's also one of the few tools we have to combat them. There’s a reason that there isn’t any organized opposition to Proposition 1. It’s a new, promising program that deserves time to shake out its minimal kinks and prove to other cities that it’s worth it. Our democracy is already under attack. Now isn’t the time to defund one of the projects that makes democracy just a little bit more accessible. Vote yes on Proposition 1. Schools Seattle School District No. 1, Director District No. 2Kathleen Smith We were so unimpressed with the Seattle School District position 2 incumbent, Sarah Clark, that we are endorsing the person who didn’t even have her website set up at the time of the endorsement meeting (it’s set up now!). Kathleen Smith is a data scientist at Microsoft. She’s soft-spoken until a topic she’s passionate about like, say, gay kids or anything about data comes up. Then she’s all fire. We can see her doing this thing. And, we might have to see her do this thing because, whew. Our other options are Eric Feeny, a top performer at Optum (okay, brag much?) who acted like a mannequin came to life and read Sam Altman’s Wikipedia page. He likes AI a little too much. And incumbent Sarah Clark, whom we expected to like, gave us absolutely nothing. Clark is director of policy at the Chamber of Commerce. This should already be a red flag according to the SECB handbook, but progressives say she separates her evil day job for the not-evil mostly-volunteer school board position. Except for a policy director, Clark did not demonstrate much, if any, policy knowledge. In fact, she had no idea what the Parents Bill of Rights was, a homophobic, transphobic Trojan horse of a ballot measure that the state legislature passed in the 2024 session and put down like a rabid dog (amended) earlier this year. This behemoth has been a national issue in education for years, and in Washington for a year and a half. Literally every other candidate for school board (even the dolts) knew what it was and why it sucked. We don’t expect Clark to know the ins and outs, but jeez, a scrap of situational awareness would be nice. You may be thinking, “Sure, but state policies shouldn’t matter too much to a local school board director.” And you’d be right. This isn’t a policymaking position—it’s a governance one. But Clark did not prove to us she had any of the passion or engagement to make the kinds of waves on the school board that she promised. And a birdie told us Clark didn’t even bother responding to the teachers’ union’s endorsement meeting invitation. You don’t have to play ball with them all the time, but show up to the game. Still, we at the SECB are nothing if not reasonable. If Clark can prove she’s got what it takes, we’ll listen. Prove the Clark who walked in our door was not the real Clark we’ve heard so much about. For now, though, we’re sticking with Smith and her spreadsheets. She has booksmarts and a lot of heart. She pushed back on the common narrative that “broken trust” was why 4,000 students have left Seattle Public Schools since 2019. She’s not discounting that, but she thinks a study is needed. And, she knows how to do data things. Have at it, Smith. A thoughtful data wonk who wants to burn down any institution that doesn’t protect its queer students is good enough for us. Especially when the alternatives are so limp. Vote Smith. Seattle School District No. 1, Director District No. 4Joe Mizrahi Look… school’s bad. Parents mad. Kids sad. We fund our schools back-asswardly and we’re, unsurprisingly, looking toward a $94 million budget deficit in Seattle Public Schools next year. They’ve faced nearly $100 million deficits three years in a row. To combat that, the geniuses on the school board debated closing a cool 21 schools last year, spawning months of big, tearful, apoplectic (and justified), public outcry. The board then did not close the schools, but the threat still looms. Parents are still angry, and distrust the board. Enrollment in SPS is down. So, who the fuck is going to fix this? In this race, the choice is clear as day. Joe Mizrahi, long-time secretary-treasurer and co-executive director of UFCW 3000, can do it. He is as qualified for it as his hair is tall. Mizrahi has experience working with complicated and deep budgets. He’s a labor guy fixated on what teachers need. He’s also an SPS parent and the incumbent. Mizrahi stepped into the role last spring when two school board members resigned over residency issues, and he’d like a full term to really effect change. Mizrahi is against closing the schools. He’s against austerity budgeting, and recognizes that the only way out of this Sisyphean ordeal of never-ending budget deficits is to lobby the legislature for progressive revenue. Mizrahi has a long résumé full of organizing for causes like the $15 minimum wage, paid sick leave and family leave. He’s wonky, passionate as hell, and will be a force fighting for better funding at the state level. When it comes to more tangible schools stuff, we of the SECB trust Mizrahi’s takes. He wants open enrollment for option schools to attract and retain SPS students and clear waitlists. He’s already thinking about protecting undocumented students from ICE raids. He’s a champion of trans youth at a time when their right to exist and their right to privacy, are under attack. And gosh, he is charming from the tip of his Jimmy Neutron hair to the fresh basket of apples he brought—SIKE. They weren’t apples. They were cake. That’s right, Mizrahi is probably the only guy who stuck to his COVID cake dupes hobby. That commitment to “Is it cake?” shows the dedication that runs through Mizrahi. Also, the cake was delicious. (He did place fourth at a cake convention once, but first place in our hearts.) Vote Mizrahi. Seattle School District No. 1, Director District No. 5Vivian Song Vivian Song resigned from the Seattle School Board over a residency conflict. Since it’s our only substantial reservation about her candidacy, we’ll start there. Shortly before declaring her candidacy in 2021, Song moved out of her family home in Capitol Hill to an apartment in Ballard so she could run in D4. In early 2024, The Seattle Times revealed that Song no longer lived in the district she moved to, she was back in Capitol Hill again. This caused drama. Accusations of racism. By the end of the month, she’d resigned. Political career over? Not so fast. Though “shy” about it at the time, Song says she moved to Ballard with the intention of divorcing her husband (we also would only move to Ballard under duress). But they worked it out and she moved back home. And Song argued her move wasn’t secret: She said she followed the rules and never hid this from the school board. Some people disagree. But it’s not just shady, messy family stuff. According to School Board policy, her move should have opened her seat in the November 2023 general election. That matters. This disclosure snafu undermined a democratic process. But the details point more to a mistake than a scandal. And we doubt she’s pulling a scheme. Again, it’s the school board. It isn’t a cash cow (pay is capped at $4,800 a year) or a golden escalator to grander political aspirations (though it’s clear Song has them, she applied for a vacant seat in City Hall. Some argue it remained vacant when Tanya Woo held it). Good news! Song is part of the wealthy, unemployed activist class and literally can’t find enough boards to serve on. More importantly to us, she never tuned out of this board. She decided to run again during the school closure mess. Tops K-8, an alternative school with a deaf and hard of hearing program (Song is hard of hearing, so is her child), was slated for execution and she wouldn’t have that. When the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association tried to ban trans girls from school sports, Song worked behind the scenes to make sure this district’s WIAA rep, School Board Director Joe Mizrahi, would have the votes to fight it. Song’s progressive credentials are legit, so her finance background isn’t a sign she’ll lean on austerity and replace all the lunch ladies with gruel boys. She’ll do things like partner with other elected leaders on progressive revenue, like Former City Council Member Teresa Mosqueda’s increase to JumpStart for student mental health support. She knows that the district is going to have to body block the federal government if they come for undocumented students, and she has detailed ideas for the ways they can serve kids from immigrant families under Trump. She’s also against armed officers in schools. This was the rare race where we liked almost everyone in the room, particularly Janis White, a special education advocate whip-smart on every school board issue. Good ideas abounded. But Song has already shown this city she can do this job well. She wanted to do it so badly that she applied for the job again after enduring her political “scandal.” That’s something, right? Vote Song! King County County ExecutiveGirmay Zahilay For more than a decade and a half, if you asked people in King County what a “County Executive” was, they might’ve said “uh, some guy named Dow Constantine?” Dow’s dynasty (Dow-nasty?) is through and it’s time for Girmay Zahilay to take charge. Zahilay, a charismatic County Council Member first elected in 2019, is already a political staple repping University District, Laurelhurst, Ravenna, Eastlake, Capitol Hill, the Central District, South Seattle, Allentown, and Skyway, but he’s never held such a powerful executive position. He can do it. And, damn it, we want him to. So do the “just fine” establishment dems like Governor Bob Ferguson, cool establishment dems like Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, and moronic warhawks like Congressman Adam Smith. Big tent! He’s also led plenty. In the five-plus years he’s been on the dais, he’s risen to current council chair and prince of fiscal management (or, in boring council speak, chair of the county’s budget and fiscal management committee. Yawn). He introduced the $1 billion Regional Workforce Housing Initiative and led the effort for a $1.2 billion property tax levy to fund mental health treatment centers. He sponsored a $2 million community-based gun violence program. He passed a five-part gun violence prevention program and supports a year-round gun buyback program. He reached these heights by knocking the legendary (read: old, respectfully) civil rights legend Larry Gossett off his perch—a big upset for an unknown lawyer from the South End who ran a nonprofit mentoring middle schoolers and came to this country as a refugee when he was 3. In our endorsement meeting, he even seemed genuinely nervous. He clearly expected our question about the child jail. In his first campaign, he made closing the detention center a huge part of his platform. But in a vote last year, he walked it back. During our endorsement meeting, Zahilay didn’t give a satisfying explanation for why he changed his mind. He says he believed the jail could be transformed with activities and community-based services. When we asked for an example of similar successes, he pointed to close-to-home facilities and “bringing the home to them through the integration of community services.” And it was a bullshit answer when there’s probably a more straightforward version: The county had nothing to replace kid jail, so the council didn’t close kid jail. This is the infrastructure we have, so Zahilay wanted to make it better. We’re not convinced that sour lemon will ever make lemonade, but Zahilay’s only real challenger in this race, County Council Member Claudia Balducci, didn’t vote any differently, and her background directing King County’s Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention is way, way more carceral. That said, these two are pretty politically aligned and did a good job at least pretending they loved each other. We like Balducci, just not as much as Zahilay. She’s a Transit Maven with political experience who is good at getting those Eastside misers to pay for things. And if we have any hope of addressing homelessness and building thousands of units of housing, someone is going to have to convince (or force) those misers to buy the biggest goose in the window (pay taxes) for Tiny Tim (us). What appeals to us aside from Zahilay’s progressive zeal and résumé, is that instead of facing east toward the suburbs à la Balducci, Zahilay will continue to face South, the direction of his district, and toward the people and places this county has neglected. At a time the federal government is literally rounding up immigrants and refugees and saying they don’t belong, we think it’s only right to elect Zahilay, so all King County residents know they belong and they matter. And we trust he’ll do right by us all. Vote Zahilay. Metropolitan King County, Council District No. 5Kim-Khánh Văn Last year, Dave Upthegrove left the King County Council to save the trees as the state Commissioner of Public Lands and, we guess, yell at tree sitters who also trying to save the trees. But that’s his problem. Ours is filling the seat he left behind (and that’s currently being warmed by long-time Tukwila City Councilmember De’Sean Quinn, who is not running). Renton City Council Member Kim-Khánh Văn stood out in a crowd of good candidates. She’s electric and her vision for this diverse district prioritizes racial equity, democratic values, and local stability as a means to weather this federal storm. When she was 6, Văn’s family fled Vietnam for a refugee camp in the Philippines and resettled in King County with the help of a nonprofit. After becoming the first in her family to graduate college, she went to law school and became an immigration attorney. She’s involved in rapid response efforts to ICE raids, and Văn is the only candidate who said “Abolish ICE.” This is the place where King County made waves (both good and bad) by housing homeless people in a vacant motel. It is also a region awash with camping bans. Văn is against those bans and homeless sweeps. She’s—forgive us for using the line—solutions-oriented. And for all the homosexual treehuggers missing Upthegrove: Văn says water is life and she’s here to save rivers. Văn’s big challenger is Steffanie Fain, whose moderate Republican husband Joe Fain was ousted from the State Senate after KUOW reported a rape allegation against him. When she filed for office, it would have been easy to assume that Fain, a lawyer and cancer survivor who has never held public office, was some kind of political puppet. Nope, she’s definitely her own woman. A very boring one who has raised a lot of money. She wants to fix the floundering King County Regional Homelessness Authority (who doesn’t?) and didn’t have an idea of how (who does?). And that was a basic theme. Fain is fine. Not an existential threat, but the absolute wrong pick for the political moment. Or, really any political moment, for that matter. Văn is the moment. We’d pick her even if Trump wasn’t dragging us all kicking and screaming into hell. South King County, perpetually overlooked and fucked over, and full of people vulnerable to federal lawlessness, deserves a fearless champion. We’re not even sure why Fain’s running. Vote Văn. Metropolitan King County, Council District No. 7Maya Vengadasalam Maya Vengadasalam is the only “Independent Democrat” in this non-partisan race with any chance of beating former Republican State Senator Pete von Reichbauer, an elder statesman who has held down his seat since 1993. Why? The man has a road named after him and he isn’t even dead. His feet are dangling from the $211,000+ war chest he’s sitting on and he lords over part of the county Republicans haven’t totally lost. So ever since the hot new rock band Nirvana was on the radio, to try was to lose and to waste money while doing it. Enter Vengadasalam. She’s a former school board director in Kent and a current leadership development consultant for the Washington State School Directors’ Association. And she’s only like $206,000 behind on fundraising! Since her whole deal is fiscal responsibility, maybe she can stretch it or blow the whole thing on a limited-run zine. While Vengadasalam wasn’t “partaking in endorsements,” she willingly answered all of our questions as long as we told you she was running a non-partisan campaign for this non-partisan office. Vengadasalam’s platform is four-prong: champion government transparency, strengthen economic growth, expand affordable housing, and advance education and safety (a two-for-one deal). Vengadasalam is no Republican, but she’s not the kind-of-handsome blue stranger that sweeps us off our feet. She’s a “where’s the money going” type who assumes the answer is waste and the solution is austerity. She’s not against progressive revenue, per se—but she wanted to be honest about the scissors in her hand. And honest she was. Vengadasalam spent six years on the finance and process management side of the Tacoma Housing Authority and didn’t even try to masquerade as a housing advocate. She bragged about her division going paperless before COVID hit. She’s got the right idea about some things, like the inhumanity of the term “camping” when applied to unsheltered homeless people, and that certainly gives her an edge over von Reichbauer, who once called homeless people outside the King County courthouse “animals” that had taken over the streets. Though we’re unconvinced she’ll solve the housing crisis with educational opportunities, unless all those graduates are comfortable with 20 or 30 roommates (we need affordable housing). She didn’t tell lies (even for her own benefit) or talk shit. There was literally nothing we could do to drag Vengadasalam into the muck and insult von Reichbauer, because she didn’t know him personally (she is strict on a two-term limit, however). It’s no fun, but how endearing. District 7 voters, we’re not thrilled about von Reichbauer’s de facto lifetime appointment. But while we still have representative democracy, why not have an election for old time’s sake? Let’s retire von Reichbauer to sunny Arizona. Vote Vengadasalam. King County Proposition No. 1Vote Yes Should we or should we not have a county parks system? The question before voters is that simple. Because if voters do not approve this property tax levy, we functionally won’t have one. The 6-year levy, last approved by voters in 2019, will support 250 parks in King County 185 miles of regional trails, 215 miles of backcountry trails and 50 square miles of open space for we, the people, to frolic, picnic, bike, and aimlessly wander. There’s splash parks, pools, ballfields, and play courts of various kinds for racket-oriented aristocrats. If we renew this levy, we maintain that system and homeowners pay 24 cents per thousand dollars of their home value each month. For the median homeowner, that comes out to $16.38 a month. It would generate $1.45 billion over the next six years. If we don’t renew this levy, say goodbye to new infrastructure improvements. Advocates say the county would close parks, or put up signs telling people to recreate at their own risk. Lawns will grow long, hedges wild. After-school programs that depend on county parks funding will suffer. We hope you and your kids like pissing yourselves, because we won’t have anybody to open the restrooms. It’s not a world we want to live in. When the SECB suggested we hold our endorsement meeting in a park, it could not have known we’d meet with this levy’s well-prepared stakeholders on the hottest day of the year so far, a 90+ degree scorcher, with glaring, headache-inducing sunlight bouncing from the concrete like a mirror. We could go on complaining about this thing that was our fault, but it wouldn’t be fair to the people who sat on the porch outside the community center at the genuinely lovely Steve Cox Memorial Park in White Center with us, or the “Log Cabin,” as it is affectionately known. It’d be especially unfair to Fin Crispy Jr., the mascot of the park’s resident summer collegiate baseball team, The DubSea Fish Sticks. They were getting deep fried in there. We didn’t see you leave Fin Crispy Jr., but hope you survived, even if childhood experiences have made some of our stomachs twist into knots whenever mascots are near (it’s a combination of your large size, wide-open, smiling mouths, and mime-like silence. It’s very disconcerting). Like we said, this levy is a no-brainer. It is also uncontested. The advocates, including County Council Member Teresa Mosqueda and Christie True, the county’s former head of natural resources and parks, could have easily shown up, sat down, told us to “vote for this or the parks are screwed,” and called it a day. But they came with data. With a deep love of the parks. Even answers for why the wealthy, who don’t think the county parks are worth a few quarters a day when their backyard, waterfront tennis courts are right there, should vote for this. No matter how rich they are, they don’t own Tiger Mountain, where they race wildly-expensive mountain bikes (yet), or the county-owned pool where little Richie Rich III has his swim meets. If this is you, and “eyesores” are one of your top concerns, consider the weeds. Are you going to schlep a bag and a weeder to your local park, or are you willing to cough up less than a dollar a day so someone else will? We’re willing to bet that’s less than the going rate for a gardener. But those homeowners would probably know better than us. When we pool our money together, we can all have nice things. Even those with little to spare. In Seattle, we’re lousy with parks. But many of the diverse, immigrant populated areas of unincorporated King County aren’t. They depend on this money. Everyone deserves a place to play, to enjoy themselves, to throw a party, to organize a cultural event, and not have to pay for it. Bummed about another property tax? Take it up with the Washington Legislature, which needed to figure out progressive revenue solutions, like, yesterday. Keeping these parks open and thriving at a time when we’re still trying to recover from the isolation and depression of the pandemic and so much public money is under federal threat is literally our civic duty. Vote YES, or don’t let us catch you frolicking in a public green space ever again. State Legislative District No. 33, State Representative Position No. 1Edwin Obras The state legislature is just getting to know Edwin Obras, the 22-year SeaTac resident who was appointed to replace Tina Orwall when she moved over to the State Senate chamber earlier this year. He’s new to politics, but very familiar with government: Before this January, he’d worked for the City of Seattle’s Human Services Department for 16 years. In the last six months, he’s managed to make an impression. He sponsored (and passed) a bill that establishes protections for isolated workers (like housekeepers, security guards, and janitors) from sexual harassment and assault. He slapped some worker protections on Uber and Lyft. And he proposed a bill that would keep companies from passing the cost of credit card processing fees to their tipped workers. Because somehow that’s still legal. “What about the other Democrat in the race?” you ask? That’s Burien Mayor Kevin Schilling, and it’s a helluva stretch to call him a Democrat. Schilling’s administration is currently suing to overturn Burien’s historic minimum wage victory. As deputy Mayor, he turned down $1 million in King County funds for a tiny home village when it conflicted with the interests of one of his major donors. He had a public fight with the King County Sheriff’s office after he tried to force them to impose a camping ban in the city. And conservative commentator Brandi Kruse considers him one of her favorite Democratic mayors. We don’t need that nonsense anywhere near the state house. And we sure as hell need someone who’s dedicated to workers’ rights. Vote Obras. Legislative District No. 41, State Representative Position No. 1Janice Zahn Well, Janice Zahn ghosted us. After she rescheduled our planned endorsement call, we just… never heard from her again. Is that encouraging? Nope! But there’s not much happening in this race. Zahn is the only Democrat running a serious campaign for this seat. She’s a former Bellevue City Councilmember, and she’s been an engineer with the Port of Seattle for more than 20 years. She was appointed to the office in January, and she’s done a few things we dig: She sharpened some definitions for autism care on the state level so people who need 24/7 care have access to it and she expanded the protections for discrimination in schools. Good stuff! Plus, we love a weirdo. When addressing the County Council, she shared that since the COVID lockdowns, she’s been collecting rocks, polishing them, and then sharing them with community members. “I carry them around in my pocket and I start giving them away to my community as I’m out in community and I see people struggling, because what I believe is that leaders need to be the calm in our community when they’re in the storm while we’re trying to help them,” she said. She’s like the socially underdeveloped white lady in Shrinking and we’re obsessed. Vote Zahn. (But Janice, get it together. We better hear from you in the general.) Legislative District No. 48, State Representative Position No. 1Osman Salahuddin Yes, Salahuddin really is as young as he looks. Actually, he’s the youngest serving member of the state legislature. So it shouldn’t surprise you that Salahuddin’s political experience is limited. Before he was unanimously appointed to this legislative seat by the King County Council earlier this year, he was two years into his term on Redmond City Council. Before that, his only political experience was as the student body president at the University of Washington. But Salahuddin has picked up the work quickly. He’s an advocate for public transit (he rode the bus from Redmond to UW every day), he understands the importance of public investment in the housing and homelessness crisis, he introduced a state bill to integrate behavioral health professionals with cops and other first responders. When we asked Salahuddin what he was most proud of since he was appointed to this legislative seat in January, he listed two pieces of legislation: the first recognized Eid as a state holiday (“It showed my community that the government exists to serve all residents,” he told us) and the second allows workers to use paid sick leave to attend their own or a family member’s immigration proceedings. The 48th legislative district is largely made up of renters (more than half), immigrants (about 40 percent) and people of color (about half). The median age is barely more than 35. “My role is a bit unique in the district I represent,” the 29-year-old child of immigrants told us, because demographically, he’s a lot more like his constituents than many representatives. If he’s elected, Salahuddin will get another year to show us what he can do. Vote Salahuddin. It’s the Primary Election 2025. We’re taking over the city. Choose your fighter. We know it’s easy to miss these odd year elections. They’re local! They’re wonky! There’s not a President in sight. Maybe you’ve used up all your fucks and your will to live watching the world sputter and burn. Or maybe you spent them watching our city government waste everyone’s time building digital advertising kiosks, painting over graffiti, trying to weaken our ethics code, and allowing cops the ability to lob blastballs into protests once again instead of finding ways to protect us from a robber baron and literal fascists. But please vote. Please please please. This year, we have the chance to swap big business politicians for scrappy progressives across the ballot. (Sara Nelson is up for reelection. Need we say more?) And if we seize the opportunity, we can also maintain the proud Seattle tradition of one-term mayors. In just a few months, we could say goodbye to the mayor who couldn’t even keep the one promise he cared about (bringing back the Seattle SuperSonics). The mayor who never managed to find a vision for Seattle’s future, because he was busy sweeping the homeless people out of downtown and into Little Saigon. But you’ll never see him holding the broom—because he’s unable to lift a finger, let alone take responsibility for this city. Seattle has rarely—if ever—allowed itself the luxury of having a progressive mayor and a progressive city council at the same time, because we’re masochists who get our rocks off at complaining about the Seattle Process. Right now, this city is currently run by vampires. Let’s take a bath in free-range fair-trade certified organic holy water and fashion a stake from lab-grown (or ethically sourced) balsa wood and get out there. This year, dare we say it, there’s a roster of honest-to-goodness actual progressives that are looking for a chance to totally transform Seattle. And they couldn’t have come at a better time. We’re staring down the pike of a Seattle comprehensive plan that will steer the next two decades of growth and infrastructure on these near-suburban streets. We’ve got a lot of work to do if we don’t want the Seattle of the future to be a charming little hamlet with $4,000-per-square-foot rents, nary a corner store in sight, and unionized robocops arresting “the nipple” at the behest of an anti-socialist neural network that’s named itself Jeff Bezos 2. So listen up, we’re choosing our mayor, our city attorney, our county executive, and three city council seats—and that’s not even the whole ballot. In the last month, we sat down with (almost) all of the candidates. They made their case. They brought us snacks that sometimes we were allergic to. Nobody even cried this year, but they screamed a lot. Idiot aside, we heard a lot of exciting ideas from inspiring people politicians. Uh oh, is our optimism showing? We hate when that happens. But if the best of the best get elected, we’ll go full frontal. Because right now we simply cannot resist the potential dripping from these ballots. Let’s fantasize for a sec: City Council District 2 is going to have a new champion. Pro-business, anti-protester (evil) Council President Sara Nelson has a real challenger in Dionne Foster. And we’re pouring our hope into Katie Wilson to once and for all send Bruce Harrell packing. You should get your ballot around July 18. If you don’t know what to do with it, we have a guide on page 20. Let’s go. We’ve got a city to fix. MayorKatie Wilson Bruce Harrell had his chance. A lifetime ago (in 2021), when Harrell first ran for mayor, he made a lot of big, substantive promises that voters seemed to believe: He pledged to build 1,000 new housing units in his first six months in office; he committed to changing the biased policing culture in SPD after the George Floyd protests; he said he didn’t believe “dispersal,” or sweeps, worked, and promised to take a “Housing First” approach to encampments around the city. Are we living in a utopia yet? In our endorsement meeting, we asked about his broken promises. We pointed out that he conducted more sweeps than his five predecessors combined. That he sunk years of municipal effort and energy into a Comprehensive Plan that won’t meet our housing needs. That he pandered to police with bruised egos, letting them become the militant thugs that we saw in Cal Anderson on Memorial Day weekend, but with higher salaries. And in an hour-long endorsement meeting, he didn’t answer for a single thing. In every case, the conditions in his city were someone else’s fault. Homelessness? The other cities in King County aren’t doing their part. The police that he says can take a hike if they don’t agree with his idea of good policing? Well, he told us, he doesn’t actually know what good policing is. They’re the experts, not him. Nothing was his responsibility. We understand why he would feel that way. Because the greatest sin of the Harrell Administration is what it hasn’t done. He’s a mayor without imagination, and with him at the helm, Seattle is a rudderless ship on a windless ocean. While tens of thousands of Seattleites are struggling to keep their head above water, he’s obsessing over penises spray painted on the overpasses, AI incubators, and digital advertising kiosks that profit private companies. There’s a perception that this race was Harrell’s from the start, so there was no use doing anything to stop him. But that’s not the case. In polling this spring, only 37 percent of Seattleites were happy with Harrell’s work in City Hall. Enough of Seattle is sick of the Harrell Show. Katie Wilson is Harrell’s opposite. If Harrell is all politics and no substance, Wilson is substance embodied. She’s been an organizer in Seattle for 15 years, and she’s built a career fighting for—and winning—campaigns like raising the minimum wage, protecting affordable transit, and building progressive revenue. Wilson’s campaign platform is clearly made by someone who’s used to making change in a system that’s built to fight against it. She has clear, step-by-step plans to build 4,000 units of shelter in four years, to streamline access to addiction and mental health treatment, and to build $1 billion worth of union-built affordable housing. Harrell made promises. Wilson actually intends to keep hers. And she knows how to do it. In our meeting, one question best captured the difference between Wilson and Harrell. We asked about the FIFA World Cup coming to Seattle in 2026. When Seattle hosted the MLB All-Star game in 2023, the city swept any encampments in the area out of sight. Surely, next year, Seattle’s mayor would have to field a fair amount of outside pressure to make visible homelessness invisible while the world’s eyes are on us. How would they respond? We gave Harrell two chances to answer the question, and he never did. Instead, he ranted about how our surrounding cities aren’t building as much shelter as we are, how he has to prioritize small businesses, said it was his responsibility to revitalize downtown, and reminded us that he signed an ordinance to make Seattle a Human Rights City. Then he turned to the other candidates, and said: “How dare you talk about the values I’ve been a part of for the last 16 years.” Wilson, meanwhile, rejected the premise of the question entirely. Not because she didn’t want to answer it, but because she had a plan to stand up enough shelter in the first six months of her term—between tiny home villages, faith communities, and vacancies throughout the city—to make the question irrelevant. “Let’s get people inside in time for the World Cup,” she said. See that, Harrell? No excuses, just a goal, a plan, and a timeline. This is why Wilson has our vote. She sees people that are struggling and thinks about solutions, not optics. She obviously, palpably gives a damn about people, and that drives her to act, not just talk. While we were writing this endorsement, Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist with a people-first platform, wiped the floor with an establishment Democrat in New York City’s primary. Mamdani’s win is proof that people can show up in droves and throw decades of political tradition in the trash and choose something better. And that to accomplish such a feat, being a hell of a politician with a great personality helps a fuckton. Wilson has the platform. What she doesn’t have is the energy. She’s quiet. She’s policy minded. She makes deeply awkward TikToks. But she knows her shit and she cares. Wilson doesn’t pull out the tear-jerking stump speech or throw down with her opposition. And while we trust that your vote will get her through the primary, we need her to throw down. Show everyone that Harrell’s empty, that he’s unelectable this time. This city wants to see that. And it wants change. Do what you need to do to give the people what they want. Show us your spine is as sturdy as that platform. We know it’s in you. Now reader, we know that Wilson isn’t the only one making a run for Harrell’s graffiti-less office (and Joe Molloy, we hope to see you run for City Council, where your good heart, and brains, would be appreciated), but she’s the only one who has the secret sauce we need to see: one-part great ideas, one-part the knowledge and experience to pull them off, two-parts the willingness to leave an easier life as an organizer to serve the city when she thinks she’s needed. We just need her to add a little heat to that sauce. If you’re still wondering if dethroning Harrell is the right decision, we’ll leave you with one more detail. For the last year, members of his administration have talked about the misogyny, bullying, and literal chest beating in City Hall since he’s been in office. We had Mayor Harrell in our conference room for just under an hour, and in that time, he did nothing to convince us that his reputation was not a completely accurate characterization. We lost count of how many times he pounded his fist onto the table and stomped his feet, and we had to shout over him more than once to stop him from yelling at other candidates. Harrell somehow made Joe Mallahan look good (well, not that good). He took control of the room—not the way a charismatic speaker captures an audience, but the way your angry uncle sucks the air out of the room on Thanksgiving. Our civic self-esteem cannot be so low. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that we need a strong, bullish personality at the helm of our city to combat everything that Trump promises to rain on us in the next three and a half years. Mayor Harrell has shown us, time and time again, that all he’s going to do is bully Seattle, not Trump. And we can’t afford that. Wilson may be quiet. But she has values. Seattle has a time-honored tradition of producing one-term mayors. Let’s make Harrell one of them. Vote Wilson. City AttorneyErika Evans In case you’ve been living under a rock for the last three-and-a-half years, let us brief you on our current City Attorney: the regrettable Republican Ann Davison. The City Attorney has two jobs: one criminal (prosecuting all of the city’s misdemeanor cases, like DUIs and domestic violence charges) and one civil (acting as the city’s attorney, either suing people or other governments and also defending Seattle in court when, for instance, the Seattle Chamber of Commerce sues the city to kill the JumpStart tax). From a criminal perspective, Davison’s whole thing is being “tough on crime,” which famously does nothing to make our city safer or to get people on the streets the help they need. She instituted policies like Close-in-Time filing. Implemented in 2022, it’s meant to reduce the criminal case backlog, but really just places the backlog in a different pile. It hasn’t worked. Her “High Utilizer Initiative” to target frequent offenders, surprise, also doesn’t solve any problems and worsens recidivism. Plus, Davison killed “community court,” an alternative system that offers people charged with misdemeanors non-punitive options to resolve their cases. Meanwhile, Davison is unforgivably behind on filing DUI cases—one of the two serious misdemeanors the office can prosecute. Domestic violence cases are lagging. Back in 2021, before Davison, it took 26 days to file a DV case. Last year, on average, it took twice as long. Davison is a tumor on the city and we don’t expect her to be willing to stand up to Trump. She converted to the Republican party during DJT’s first term, when anyone with an ounce of sense jumped ship. When King County, San Francisco, Santa Clara County, Portland, and New Haven signed onto a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security for their attacks on “sanctuary jurisdictions,” Davison dragged her feet, only joining the lawsuit months later. Meanwhile, while Boston and 43 other cities (including our less progressive neighbors, Spokane and Olympia) fought cuts to federal research funding, Davison stayed out of it. This person cannot protect us from the next three-and-a-half years (or more) of authoritarian encroachment. So, she sucks. We can’t let her win again. And she could. With three progressive challengers splitting the left vote, Davison will almost certainly skate through the primary, liberal Seattle bubble be damned. The people who didn’t march in the No Kings rally get ballots, too! Of this bunch, we believe Erika Evans, a former assistant US Attorney, is our choice to best Ann, make the City Attorney’s office effective and fair, and protect Seattle from the Trump administration. Evans has prosecuted hate crimes, she’s gone after drug traffickers, she’s slapped the wrists of business owners dipping into their employees’ wages, and she was involved in a case prosecuting January 6ers from Puyallup. Her résumé is impressive. Her platform (speed up DUI and DV case filings, bring back community court, prosecute wage theft, improve the police union contract to allow for more policing alternatives) mirrors the platforms of her opponents. But they don’t have her grit. In our meeting, Evans leapt for her opponents’ throats. She presented exhibits for every argument, and demonstrated a deep understanding of the power, and limitations, of the City Attorney’s Office. She spoke thoughtfully about the importance of working closely with Washington Attorney General Nick Brown against the constitutionally intolerant Trump administration, and made a commitment to not prosecute “peaceful” protesters (though she wouldn’t define a “peaceful protester” for us, which is peak prosecutor brain). We also love a prop comedian: she brought Jarritos and African Black soap to symbolize SOAP/SODA laws, a Raggedy Ann doll to represent Davison, a printout of photos of the white men who have held this office for the 150 years before Ann got the job, a binder of her and her opponents case files. Sure, she gave Model-UN vibes, and if being corny were illegal this woman would be in jail. But it isn’t. And what we care about is Evans’s ability and will to protect us when Trump goes after this city. We know, we know. A history as a prosecutor brings with it a track record of upholding a system built for oppression. But our federal government is actively antagonistic to cities like ours, and a prosecutor knows how the federal government works. Evans knows what levers to pull. And local progressives such as City Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck and State Rep. Shaun Scott believe she’s the right choice despite all the prosecutorial baggage. But we don’t discount her mistakes and our misgivings. Evans voted for Bruce Harrell last election (“But I voted for Nikkita Oliver twice when they ran,” Evans said). She donated $100 to Harrell’s campaign before Katie Wilson got into the race, but wouldn’t say whom she was voting for in this election, and hedged by saying she couldn’t talk shit when the winner could be her client. Public defenders are worried about what her real intentions are and how she’ll act when she’s in the seat of power. We understand where they’re coming from. But we’re inviting her to prove them wrong. This wasn’t an easy decision. Any of Davison’s challengers would be wildly better for Seattle. We wish we could have endorsed Nathan Rouse, the public defender running for the seat, because he knows the system doesn’t work for everyday people and wants to change it. He’s tougher on the Seattle Police Officers Guild than any other candidates. But he didn’t convince us he could put his ideas into action or win. Please run again next time, Nathan. We want to see you in our swivel chairs again, with more experience under your belt. Thanks for the Pop-Tarts. And Rory O’Sullivan could do a perfectly fine job in the role. But he lacks trial experience. And most importantly, we aren’t confident he could beat Davison. Evans will hit the ground running in a way we need. Here’s to knocking Davison into the stratosphere. Vote Evans. City Council, District No. 2Eddie Lin We didn’t know what kind of fresh hell we were in for when District 2 City Councilmember Tammy Morales bowed out of office one year into her second term. The appointment process sucked; the unimaginative snoozers on the city council selected multiple-SECB-endorsement-loser Mark Solomon to take the seat. Luckily, Solomon isn’t running to keep the seat, so we have an open race on our hands! Which brings us to the pool of four viable D2 hopefuls: Union guy and SDCI inspector Jamie Fackler; restaurant organizer and activist Jeanie Chunn; assistant city attorney Eddie Lin; and mayoral transportation engagement manager Adonis Ducksworth. After a lively (read: tense, yell-y) discussion, the clear choice for D2 is Eddie Lin. As an assistant city attorney, Lin’s focus for the last several years has been working with the Office of Housing. When it comes to housing, and building more of it, Lin knows his stuff. In the midst of a never-ending housing crisis and a new Social Housing Developer on its way through the Seattle Process’s long birth canal, we need someone who can get shit done. Lin knows we need subsidized affordable units, social housing, limited equity co-ops, and everything else under the sun to get people four walls and a roof. Plus, whoever sits on council will implement Mayor Bruce Harrell’s Comprehensive Plan. Lin, a fiend for density and walkable neighborhoods, is a smart choice to kickstart the next 20 years of Seattle’s growth. One of the main hits against Lin, as Fackler repeatedly brought up, was that he didn’t go all out championing Proposition 1A, the voter measure that set up a funding mechanism for the Social Housing Developer. Lin didn't vote for it because, as a housing wonk, he was concerned that it was vulnerable to being undermined by a more conservative, Chamber-backed City Council. However, he says he’s come around and is ready to champion it. He’s also a total slut (sorry, Eddie) for progressive revenue. He’s DFAIT (Down For An Income Tax), a vacancy tax, and a city-level capital gains tax. We liked Chunn’s idea for a commercial vacancy tax, but felt she was still a little too green to hack it in City Hall. We hope to see her again. The other knock against Lin is, like all other candidates except Chunn, he wants more cops. Lin’s desire for increased police presence does go hand-in-hand with hiring a more diverse police force and expanding police alternatives. Plus, Lin’s experience with police brutality made him wary of cops. In his 20s, a Minneapolis police officer cuffed him, put his hands on his throat, and made racist comments—confusing Lin, who is Asian, for a Native American. The rattling experience forever changed Lin’s view of policing. We felt Fackler, while progressive and knowledgeable about the same issues, was too soft on the cops, especially their union. We’re certain Ducksworth will win the Seattle Times endorsement. He’s suave, charming, and doesn’t answer a single question. He’s also fucking cool. Sadly, underneath his skater chic, Ducksworth is nothing but a visionless moderate (read: Bruce Harrell). We already doubted he’d be our guy from the start, and he did us a solid by confirming that with a shitty, uninformed comment blaming drug users for their own predicament. “I did the ride along last week, and these guys asked at least 50 people, are they ready to go to treatment? We got one. We got one. So this comes down to the person on the street, too. Who wants to get off the street,” Ducksworth said. “That’s because some of the treatment options are not—,” Lin said. “They’re not asking about the treatment options,” Ducksworth interrupted. “They’re getting high.” Ducksworth’s mask came off. We did not like it under there. So, Lin is our guy. He’s the whole package. He’s a cat guy and a dog guy. He’s a public schools champion. This is why we willfully turned a blind eye to the fact that he could only name two examples when asked what his four favorite films were and one of them was White Lotus Season 1, famously not a movie. If he’s even seen a movie, he wasn’t paying attention. There weren’t enough housing solutions for his taste. Vote Lin. City Council, Position No. 8Alexis Mercedes Rinck When we endorsed Alexis Mercedes Rinck in 2024, we had a lot to say about what she wouldn’t do: She wouldn’t stoop to a lower minimum wage, she wouldn’t make it easier for landlords to evict you, she wouldn’t reduce oversight on cops, she wouldn’t help corporations hoard more wealth. That was because we knew that if she was elected, she (and at the time, Tammy Morales before she was bullied out of City Hall) would be a progressive in a sea of conservatism. As we hoped, she pushed back: She voted against giving SPD more access to “less lethal” weapons, and when her colleagues approved additional surveillance from law enforcement, she opposed it. But more important than what she didn’t do is what she did. Despite being on council with people allergic to helping the city, Rinck found other ways to show up. She supported counterprotesters at a Christian Supremacist group in Cal Anderson, and was instrumental in convincing the city to deescalate the situation. She spoke out at the committee hearing when Council Member Cathy Moore tried to defang our city’s ethics code, even though she wasn’t on that committee (and even though Council President Sara Nelson tried desperately to shut her up). Rinck knows that being on city council gives her a voice, and she’s shown us over and over again that she’s willing to use it for ordinary people. She’s also clearly the voice we need to start fixing our ass-backward revenue streams in Seattle. Just weeks after our endorsement interview, she presented a collaborative effort with the mayor to reform our tax code to reduce the taxes that small businesses are paying, shift the burden to big business, and raise an extra $90 million in the process. Now that’s what we call progressive revenue! Rinck doesn’t have much competition in this race. Her standout opponent is Rachael Savage, who quite frankly fascinates us, even if we had to sage the office after she left. A Republican with chunky jewelry and overlined lipstick who started the election season running for mayor, Savage switched to a City Council race just before the filing deadline. She owns a new-age shop on Capitol Hill, runs a meditation program, and believes that her experience getting sober justifies her argument that people who are mentally ill or dealing with “late-stage” addiction should be shipped to facilities for Shiny Happy People outside of the city. Oh, and she told us words are never violent and hate speech doesn’t exist. This election has the chance to reshape our city council into a functioning governing body (would we even recognize it?) and we want to see what Rinck can do when she’s not swimming upstream. Vote Rinck. City Council, Position No. 9Dionne Foster Seattle will not have a functional city government until Sara Nelson is KO’d so far out of our political orbit that she’ll be nothing more than a footnote: a forgettable, one-time City Council President who reigned over this legislative body during a remarkably chaotic and useless time in its history. At this point, progressives would endorse a cinder block over Nelson if it had a pulse and a fixed Seattle address. Fortunately, we don’t have to. Because we have Dionne Foster, an excellent candidate for this office. Rejoice! Foster, a former policy advisor for the city and the former executive director of the nonprofit Washington Progress Alliance, is a knowledgeable, likable, competent wonk. She wants to lead the way on economic justice. Stop this city’s affordability crisis and addiction to sweeps from displacing people. She’ll fight conservatives on this council willing to divert JumpStart funds from affordable housing. Unlike Nelson, Foster knows Seattle must go harder for housing density than the legal minimum set by the state and that it’s unrealistic for a real city expecting major growth in the next two decades to click its ruby red heels, ignore its housing needs, and remain an overgrown, dysfunctional suburb forever. Foster also wants to embrace affordability and outrun Washington’s regressive tax code with progressive revenue. She wants a municipal capital gains tax, a vacancy tax, and working with the state on a mansion tax. She has the right plans and can articulate exactly how she’d implement them, a rare quality on our curb-busting city council. She’s granular, but not myopic. And we believe her because she already did this work at the state level to pass the limited capital gains tax Foster has earned a heap of endorsements from politicians like Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, State Rep. Shaun Scott (D-43), and Scott’s dearly departed predecessor, Frank Chopp, because she is the best, quickest-witted candidate to walk through our door this election cycle. With two other seats up for reelection, that’s a chance she won’t be a progressive island on council. Nelson, on the other hand, is a fundamentally un-democratic chaos agent and a disastrous leader whose sole purpose has been to accumulate political power. Her Council’s “accomplishments” have been wildly unpopular: Approving a police contract with big raises and no accountability? Putting blast balls back in the hands of untrustworthy cops, and ensuring they can surveil us? Establishing “stay out” zones for drug users and sex workers that stigmatize people and don’t work? Attempting to weaken our ethics code and repeal protections for gig workers? We’re embarrassed. Seattle is immobilized in Nelson’s… full Nelson, controlled by business interests who shelled out hundreds of thousands of dollars for her meandering status quo that squeezes the renters, the poor, the homeless, and the disadvantaged on the margins. A skilled politician at least pretends to listen. Nelson is either incapable or indifferent. She shuts down anyone who is too loud and cumbersome for her taste. Her hostility for representative government and working people is boundless. But in her hallowed chambers at least we’ll have decorum, won’t we? Her contempt for the public seemed like the only reason competitor Connor Nash, a former state and federal employee, joined this race. Mia Jacobsen, on the other hand, is running a protest campaign to overhaul the system that puts people like Nelson in the driver’s seat. Nash was angry, shooed away too many times. But Nelson isn’t just the rock and the hard place. She’s a liability. A threat to reforms from a more progressive council, a roadblock to desperately needed progress on housing and homelessness, and the last person we want in city government when President Donald Trump comes to play. We’re tired of incompetence. We want someone with ideas, who loves this city and its people. A vote for Nelson is a vote for nihilism. A vote for Foster is a vote for intelligence, compassion, solutions, and a chance for a future. Vote Foster. Proposition No. 1Vote Yes If you’re registered to vote in Seattle, you’ve probably had a chance to see the Democracy Voucher Program (DVP) in action: a blue and white envelope arrives in your mailbox with a small stack of $25 coupons; you, the voter, are invited to spend them on any candidate you like. It’s Seattle’s own, first-in-the-nation public campaign financing program. And Proposition 1 asks if we want to renew the levy that funds it for another decade. The new levy would be funded through a property tax, and it’s expected to raise $45 million over 10 years, costing the average homeowner $12.20 a year. By most metrics, the DVP has been a roaring success. It makes primaries more competitive and campaigning accessible to more diverse candidates, and the vast majority of people running for office in Seattle participate in the program. More than 106,000 Seattleites have slipped their vouchers to candidates, and according to the City, through 2024, we’ve distributed more than $10 million to local campaigns. It’s difficult to find opponents to the DVP (the opposition statement is written by right-wing radio host Ari Hoffman). But supporters of the program still have complaints. The most common concern is that when we introduced the Democracy Voucher Program (which limits the amount of money a candidate can accept), spending from lobbyists skyrocketed (which remained unlimited). But lobbying spending has shot up across the region, not just here in Seattle. And even if it did push lobbyists to up their game, it's also one of the few tools we have to combat them. There’s a reason that there isn’t any organized opposition to Proposition 1. It’s a new, promising program that deserves time to shake out its minimal kinks and prove to other cities that it’s worth it. Our democracy is already under attack. Now isn’t the time to defund one of the projects that makes democracy just a little bit more accessible. Vote yes on Proposition 1. Seattle School District No. 1, Director District No. 2Kathleen Smith We were so unimpressed with the Seattle School District position 2 incumbent, Sarah Clark, that we are endorsing the person who didn’t even have her website set up at the time of the endorsement meeting (it’s set up now!). Kathleen Smith is a data scientist at Microsoft. She’s soft-spoken until a topic she’s passionate about like, say, gay kids or anything about data comes up. Then she’s all fire. We can see her doing this thing. And, we might have to see her do this thing because, whew. Our other options are Eric Feeny, a top performer at Optum (okay, brag much?) who acted like a mannequin came to life and read Sam Altman’s Wikipedia page. He likes AI a little too much. And incumbent Sarah Clark, whom we expected to like, gave us absolutely nothing. Clark is director of policy at the Chamber of Commerce. This should already be a red flag according to the SECB handbook, but progressives say she separates her evil day job for the not-evil mostly-volunteer school board position. Except for a policy director, Clark did not demonstrate much, if any, policy knowledge. In fact, she had no idea what the Parents Bill of Rights was, a homophobic, transphobic Trojan horse of a ballot measure that the state legislature passed in the 2024 session and put down like a rabid dog (amended) earlier this year. This behemoth has been a national issue in education for years, and in Washington for a year and a half. Literally every other candidate for school board (even the dolts) knew what it was and why it sucked. We don’t expect Clark to know the ins and outs, but jeez, a scrap of situational awareness would be nice. You may be thinking, “Sure, but state policies shouldn’t matter too much to a local school board director.” And you’d be right. This isn’t a policymaking position—it’s a governance one. But Clark did not prove to us she had any of the passion or engagement to make the kinds of waves on the school board that she promised. And a birdie told us Clark didn’t even bother responding to the teachers’ union’s endorsement meeting invitation. You don’t have to play ball with them all the time, but show up to the game. Still, we at the SECB are nothing if not reasonable. If Clark can prove she’s got what it takes, we’ll listen. Prove the Clark who walked in our door was not the real Clark we’ve heard so much about. For now, though, we’re sticking with Smith and her spreadsheets. She has booksmarts and a lot of heart. She pushed back on the common narrative that “broken trust” was why 4,000 students have left Seattle Public Schools since 2019. She’s not discounting that, but she thinks a study is needed. And, she knows how to do data things. Have at it, Smith. A thoughtful data wonk who wants to burn down any institution that doesn’t protect its queer students is good enough for us. Especially when the alternatives are so limp. Vote Smith. Seattle School District No. 1, Director District No. 4Joe Mizrahi Look… school’s bad. Parents mad. Kids sad. We fund our schools back-asswardly and we’re, unsurprisingly, looking toward a $94 million budget deficit in Seattle Public Schools next year. They’ve faced nearly $100 million deficits three years in a row. To combat that, the geniuses on the school board debated closing a cool 21 schools last year, spawning months of big, tearful, apoplectic (and justified), public outcry. The board then did not close the schools, but the threat still looms. Parents are still angry, and distrust the board. Enrollment in SPS is down. So, who the fuck is going to fix this? In this race, the choice is clear as day. Joe Mizrahi, long-time secretary-treasurer and co-executive director of UFCW 3000, can do it. He is as qualified for it as his hair is tall. Mizrahi has experience working with complicated and deep budgets. He’s a labor guy fixated on what teachers need. He’s also an SPS parent and the incumbent. Mizrahi stepped into the role last spring when two school board members resigned over residency issues, and he’d like a full term to really effect change. Mizrahi is against closing the schools. He’s against austerity budgeting, and recognizes that the only way out of this Sisyphean ordeal of never-ending budget deficits is to lobby the legislature for progressive revenue. Mizrahi has a long résumé full of organizing for causes like the $15 minimum wage, paid sick leave and family leave. He’s wonky, passionate as hell, and will be a force fighting for better funding at the state level. When it comes to more tangible schools stuff, we of the SECB trust Mizrahi’s takes. He wants open enrollment for option schools to attract and retain SPS students and clear waitlists. He’s already thinking about protecting undocumented students from ICE raids. He’s a champion of trans youth at a time when their right to exist and their right to privacy, are under attack. And gosh, he is charming from the tip of his Jimmy Neutron hair to the fresh basket of apples he brought—SIKE. They weren’t apples. They were cake. That’s right, Mizrahi is probably the only guy who stuck to his COVID cake dupes hobby. That commitment to “Is it cake?” shows the dedication that runs through Mizrahi. Also, the cake was delicious. (He did place fourth at a cake convention once, but first place in our hearts.) Vote Mizrahi. Seattle School District No. 1, Director District No. 5Vivian Song Vivian Song resigned from the Seattle School Board over a residency conflict. Since it’s our only substantial reservation about her candidacy, we’ll start there. Shortly before declaring her candidacy in 2021, Song moved out of her family home in Capitol Hill to an apartment in Ballard so she could run in D4. In early 2024, The Seattle Times revealed that Song no longer lived in the district she moved to, she was back in Capitol Hill again. This caused drama. Accusations of racism. By the end of the month, she’d resigned. Political career over? Not so fast. Though “shy” about it at the time, Song says she moved to Ballard with the intention of divorcing her husband (we also would only move to Ballard under duress). But they worked it out and she moved back home. And Song argued her move wasn’t secret: She said she followed the rules and never hid this from the school board. Some people disagree. But it’s not just shady, messy family stuff. According to School Board policy, her move should have opened her seat in the November 2023 general election. That matters. This disclosure snafu undermined a democratic process. But the details point more to a mistake than a scandal. And we doubt she’s pulling a scheme. Again, it’s the school board. It isn’t a cash cow (pay is capped at $4,800 a year) or a golden escalator to grander political aspirations (though it’s clear Song has them, she applied for a vacant seat in City Hall. Some argue it remained vacant when Tanya Woo held it). Good news! Song is part of the wealthy, unemployed activist class and literally can’t find enough boards to serve on. More importantly to us, she never tuned out of this board. She decided to run again during the school closure mess. Tops K-8, an alternative school with a deaf and hard of hearing program (Song is hard of hearing, so is her child), was slated for execution and she wouldn’t have that. When the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association tried to ban trans girls from school sports, Song worked behind the scenes to make sure this district’s WIAA rep, School Board Director Joe Mizrahi, would have the votes to fight it. Song’s progressive credentials are legit, so her finance background isn’t a sign she’ll lean on austerity and replace all the lunch ladies with gruel boys. She’ll do things like partner with other elected leaders on progressive revenue, like Former City Council Member Teresa Mosqueda’s increase to JumpStart for student mental health support. She knows that the district is going to have to body block the federal government if they come for undocumented students, and she has detailed ideas for the ways they can serve kids from immigrant families under Trump. She’s also against armed officers in schools. This was the rare race where we liked almost everyone in the room, particularly Janis White, a special education advocate whip-smart on every school board issue. Good ideas abounded. But Song has already shown this city she can do this job well. She wanted to do it so badly that she applied for the job again after enduring her political “scandal.” That’s something, right? Vote Song! County ExecutiveGirmay Zahilay For more than a decade and a half, if you asked people in King County what a “County Executive” was, they might’ve said “uh, some guy named Dow Constantine?” Dow’s dynasty (Dow-nasty?) is through and it’s time for Girmay Zahilay to take charge. Zahilay, a charismatic County Council Member first elected in 2019, is already a political staple repping University District, Laurelhurst, Ravenna, Eastlake, Capitol Hill, the Central District, South Seattle, Allentown, and Skyway, but he’s never held such a powerful executive position. He can do it. And, damn it, we want him to. So do the “just fine” establishment dems like Governor Bob Ferguson, cool establishment dems like Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, and moronic warhawks like Congressman Adam Smith. Big tent! He’s also led plenty. In the five-plus years he’s been on the dais, he’s risen to current council chair and prince of fiscal management (or, in boring council speak, chair of the county’s budget and fiscal management committee. Yawn). He introduced the $1 billion Regional Workforce Housing Initiative and led the effort for a $1.2 billion property tax levy to fund mental health treatment centers. He sponsored a $2 million community-based gun violence program. He passed a five-part gun violence prevention program and supports a year-round gun buyback program. He reached these heights by knocking the legendary (read: old, respectfully) civil rights legend Larry Gossett off his perch—a big upset for an unknown lawyer from the South End who ran a nonprofit mentoring middle schoolers and came to this country as a refugee when he was 3. In our endorsement meeting, he even seemed genuinely nervous. He clearly expected our question about the child jail. In his first campaign, he made closing the detention center a huge part of his platform. But in a vote last year, he walked it back. During our endorsement meeting, Zahilay didn’t give a satisfying explanation for why he changed his mind. He says he believed the jail could be transformed with activities and community-based services. When we asked for an example of similar successes, he pointed to close-to-home facilities and “bringing the home to them through the integration of community services.” And it was a bullshit answer when there’s probably a more straightforward version: The county had nothing to replace kid jail, so the council didn’t close kid jail. This is the infrastructure we have, so Zahilay wanted to make it better. We’re not convinced that sour lemon will ever make lemonade, but Zahilay’s only real challenger in this race, County Council Member Claudia Balducci, didn’t vote any differently, and her background directing King County’s Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention is way, way more carceral. That said, these two are pretty politically aligned and did a good job at least pretending they loved each other. We like Balducci, just not as much as Zahilay. She’s a Transit Maven with political experience who is good at getting those Eastside misers to pay for things. And if we have any hope of addressing homelessness and building thousands of units of housing, someone is going to have to convince (or force) those misers to buy the biggest goose in the window (pay taxes) for Tiny Tim (us). What appeals to us aside from Zahilay’s progressive zeal and résumé, is that instead of facing east toward the suburbs à la Balducci, Zahilay will continue to face South, the direction of his district, and toward the people and places this county has neglected. At a time the federal government is literally rounding up immigrants and refugees and saying they don’t belong, we think it’s only right to elect Zahilay, so all King County residents know they belong and they matter. And we trust he’ll do right by us all. Vote Zahilay. Metropolitan King County, Council District No. 5Kim-Khánh Văn Last year, Dave Upthegrove left the King County Council to save the trees as the state Commissioner of Public Lands and, we guess, yell at tree sitters who also trying to save the trees. But that’s his problem. Ours is filling the seat he left behind (and that’s currently being warmed by long-time Tukwila City Councilmember De’Sean Quinn, who is not running). Renton City Council Member Kim-Khánh Văn stood out in a crowd of good candidates. She’s electric and her vision for this diverse district prioritizes racial equity, democratic values, and local stability as a means to weather this federal storm. When she was 6, Văn’s family fled Vietnam for a refugee camp in the Philippines and resettled in King County with the help of a nonprofit. After becoming the first in her family to graduate college, she went to law school and became an immigration attorney. She’s involved in rapid response efforts to ICE raids, and Văn is the only candidate who said “Abolish ICE.” This is the place where King County made waves (both good and bad) by housing homeless people in a vacant motel. It is also a region awash with camping bans. Văn is against those bans and homeless sweeps. She’s—forgive us for using the line—solutions-oriented. And for all the homosexual treehuggers missing Upthegrove: Văn says water is life and she’s here to save rivers. Văn’s big challenger is Steffanie Fain, whose moderate Republican husband Joe Fain was ousted from the State Senate after KUOW reported a rape allegation against him. When she filed for office, it would have been easy to assume that Fain, a lawyer and cancer survivor who has never held public office, was some kind of political puppet. Nope, she’s definitely her own woman. A very boring one who has raised a lot of money. She wants to fix the floundering King County Regional Homelessness Authority (who doesn’t?) and didn’t have an idea of how (who does?). And that was a basic theme. Fain is fine. Not an existential threat, but the absolute wrong pick for the political moment. Or, really any political moment, for that matter. Văn is the moment. We’d pick her even if Trump wasn’t dragging us all kicking and screaming into hell. South King County, perpetually overlooked and fucked over, and full of people vulnerable to federal lawlessness, deserves a fearless champion. We’re not even sure why Fain’s running. Vote Văn. Metropolitan King County, Council District No. 7Maya Vengadasalam Maya Vengadasalam is the only “Independent Democrat” in this non-partisan race with any chance of beating former Republican State Senator Pete von Reichbauer, an elder statesman who has held down his seat since 1993. Why? The man has a road named after him and he isn’t even dead. His feet are dangling from the $211,000+ war chest he’s sitting on and he lords over part of the county Republicans haven’t totally lost. So ever since the hot new rock band Nirvana was on the radio, to try was to lose and to waste money while doing it. Enter Vengadasalam. She’s a former school board director in Kent and a current leadership development consultant for the Washington State School Directors’ Association. And she’s only like $206,000 behind on fundraising! Since her whole deal is fiscal responsibility, maybe she can stretch it or blow the whole thing on a limited-run zine. While Vengadasalam wasn’t “partaking in endorsements,” she willingly answered all of our questions as long as we told you she was running a non-partisan campaign for this non-partisan office. Vengadasalam’s platform is four-prong: champion government transparency, strengthen economic growth, expand affordable housing, and advance education and safety (a two-for-one deal). Vengadasalam is no Republican, but she’s not the kind-of-handsome blue stranger that sweeps us off our feet. She’s a “where’s the money going” type who assumes the answer is waste and the solution is austerity. She’s not against progressive revenue, per se—but she wanted to be honest about the scissors in her hand. And honest she was. Vengadasalam spent six years on the finance and process management side of the Tacoma Housing Authority and didn’t even try to masquerade as a housing advocate. She bragged about her division going paperless before COVID hit. She’s got the right idea about some things, like the inhumanity of the term “camping” when applied to unsheltered homeless people, and that certainly gives her an edge over von Reichbauer, who once called homeless people outside the King County courthouse “animals” that had taken over the streets. Though we’re unconvinced she’ll solve the housing crisis with educational opportunities, unless all those graduates are comfortable with 20 or 30 roommates (we need affordable housing). She didn’t tell lies (even for her own benefit) or talk shit. There was literally nothing we could do to drag Vengadasalam into the muck and insult von Reichbauer, because she didn’t know him personally (she is strict on a two-term limit, however). It’s no fun, but how endearing. District 7 voters, we’re not thrilled about von Reichbauer’s de facto lifetime appointment. But while we still have representative democracy, why not have an election for old time’s sake? Let’s retire von Reichbauer to sunny Arizona. Vote Vengadasalam. King County Proposition No. 1Vote Yes Should we or should we not have a county parks system? The question before voters is that simple. Because if voters do not approve this property tax levy, we functionally won’t have one. The 6-year levy, last approved by voters in 2019, will support 250 parks in King County 185 miles of regional trails, 215 miles of backcountry trails and 50 square miles of open space for we, the people, to frolic, picnic, bike, and aimlessly wander. There’s splash parks, pools, ballfields, and play courts of various kinds for racket-oriented aristocrats. If we renew this levy, we maintain that system and homeowners pay 24 cents per thousand dollars of their home value each month. For the median homeowner, that comes out to $16.38 a month. It would generate $1.45 billion over the next six years. If we don’t renew this levy, say goodbye to new infrastructure improvements. Advocates say the county would close parks, or put up signs telling people to recreate at their own risk. Lawns will grow long, hedges wild. After-school programs that depend on county parks funding will suffer. We hope you and your kids like pissing yourselves, because we won’t have anybody to open the restrooms. It’s not a world we want to live in. When the SECB suggested we hold our endorsement meeting in a park, it could not have known we’d meet with this levy’s well-prepared stakeholders on the hottest day of the year so far, a 90+ degree scorcher, with glaring, headache-inducing sunlight bouncing from the concrete like a mirror. We could go on complaining about this thing that was our fault, but it wouldn’t be fair to the people who sat on the porch outside the community center at the genuinely lovely Steve Cox Memorial Park in White Center with us, or the “Log Cabin,” as it is affectionately known. It’d be especially unfair to Fin Crispy Jr., the mascot of the park’s resident summer collegiate baseball team, The DubSea Fish Sticks. They were getting deep fried in there. We didn’t see you leave Fin Crispy Jr., but hope you survived, even if childhood experiences have made some of our stomachs twist into knots whenever mascots are near (it’s a combination of your large size, wide-open, smiling mouths, and mime-like silence. It’s very disconcerting). Like we said, this levy is a no-brainer. It is also uncontested. The advocates, including County Council Member Teresa Mosqueda and Christie True, the county’s former head of natural resources and parks, could have easily shown up, sat down, told us to “vote for this or the parks are screwed,” and called it a day. But they came with data. With a deep love of the parks. Even answers for why the wealthy, who don’t think the county parks are worth a few quarters a day when their backyard, waterfront tennis courts are right there, should vote for this. No matter how rich they are, they don’t own Tiger Mountain, where they race wildly-expensive mountain bikes (yet), or the county-owned pool where little Richie Rich III has his swim meets. If this is you, and “eyesores” are one of your top concerns, consider the weeds. Are you going to schlep a bag and a weeder to your local park, or are you willing to cough up less than a dollar a day so someone else will? We’re willing to bet that’s less than the going rate for a gardener. But those homeowners would probably know better than us. When we pool our money together, we can all have nice things. Even those with little to spare. In Seattle, we’re lousy with parks. But many of the diverse, immigrant populated areas of unincorporated King County aren’t. They depend on this money. Everyone deserves a place to play, to enjoy themselves, to throw a party, to organize a cultural event, and not have to pay for it. Bummed about another property tax? Take it up with the Washington Legislature, which needed to figure out progressive revenue solutions, like, yesterday. Keeping these parks open and thriving at a time when we’re still trying to recover from the isolation and depression of the pandemic and so much public money is under federal threat is literally our civic duty. Vote YES, or don’t let us catch you frolicking in a public green space ever again. Legislative District No. 33, State Representative Position No. 1Edwin Obras The state legislature is just getting to know Edwin Obras, the 22-year SeaTac resident who was appointed to replace Tina Orwall when she moved over to the State Senate chamber earlier this year. He’s new to politics, but very familiar with government: Before this January, he’d worked for the City of Seattle’s Human Services Department for 16 years. In the last six months, he’s managed to make an impression. He sponsored (and passed) a bill that establishes protections for isolated workers (like housekeepers, security guards, and janitors) from sexual harassment and assault. He slapped some worker protections on Uber and Lyft. And he proposed a bill that would keep companies from passing the cost of credit card processing fees to their tipped workers. Because somehow that’s still legal. “What about the other Democrat in the race?” you ask? That’s Burien Mayor Kevin Schilling, and it’s a helluva stretch to call him a Democrat. Schilling’s administration is currently suing to overturn Burien’s historic minimum wage victory. As deputy Mayor, he turned down $1 million in King County funds for a tiny home village when it conflicted with the interests of one of his major donors. He had a public fight with the King County Sheriff’s office after he tried to force them to impose a camping ban in the city. And conservative commentator Brandi Kruse considers him one of her favorite Democratic mayors. We don’t need that nonsense anywhere near the state house. And we sure as hell need someone who’s dedicated to workers’ rights. Vote Obras. Legislative District No. 41, State Representative Position No. 1Janice Zahn Well, Janice Zahn ghosted us. After she rescheduled our planned endorsement call, we just… never heard from her again. Is that encouraging? Nope! But there’s not much happening in this race. Zahn is the only Democrat running a serious campaign for this seat. She’s a former Bellevue City Councilmember, and she’s been an engineer with the Port of Seattle for more than 20 years. She was appointed to the office in January, and she’s done a few things we dig: She sharpened some definitions for autism care on the state level so people who need 24/7 care have access to it and she expanded the protections for discrimination in schools. Good stuff! Plus, we love a weirdo. When addressing the County Council, she shared that since the COVID lockdowns, she’s been collecting rocks, polishing them, and then sharing them with community members. “I carry them around in my pocket and I start giving them away to my community as I’m out in community and I see people struggling, because what I believe is that leaders need to be the calm in our community when they’re in the storm while we’re trying to help them,” she said. She’s like the socially underdeveloped white lady in Shrinking and we’re obsessed. Vote Zahn. (But Janice, get it together. We better hear from you in the general.) Legislative District No. 48, State Representative Position No. 1Osman Salahuddin Yes, Salahuddin really is as young as he looks. Actually, he’s the youngest serving member of the state legislature. So it shouldn’t surprise you that Salahuddin’s political experience is limited. Before he was unanimously appointed to this legislative seat by the King County Council earlier this year, he was two years into his term on Redmond City Council. Before that, his only political experience was as the student body president at the University of Washington. But Salahuddin has picked up the work quickly. He’s an advocate for public transit (he rode the bus from Redmond to UW every day), he understands the importance of public investment in the housing and homelessness crisis, he introduced a state bill to integrate behavioral health professionals with cops and other first responders. When we asked Salahuddin what he was most proud of since he was appointed to this legislative seat in January, he listed two pieces of legislation: the first recognized Eid as a state holiday (“It showed my community that the government exists to serve all residents,” he told us) and the second allows workers to use paid sick leave to attend their own or a family member’s immigration proceedings. The 48th legislative district is largely made up of renters (more than half), immigrants (about 40 percent) and people of color (about half). The median age is barely more than 35. “My role is a bit unique in the district I represent,” the 29-year-old child of immigrants told us, because demographically, he’s a lot more like his constituents than many representatives. If he’s elected, Salahuddin will get another year to show us what he can do. Vote Salahuddin.",,"['mayor', 'mayoral', 'city council', 'councilmember', 'election', 'candidate', 'municipal', 'governance', 'harrell', 'bruce harrell', 'wilson', 'katie wilson', 'mallahan', 'joe mallahan', 'molloy', 'joe molloy', 'savage', 'davison', 'ann davison', 'morales', 'tammy morales', 'mosqueda', 'teresa mosqueda', 'nelson', 'sara nelson', 'oliver', 'foster', 'budget', 'housing', 'homeless', 'homelessness', 'transportation', 'police', 'SPD', 'infrastructure', 'taxes', 'labor', 'union', 'workers', 'organizing', 'policy', 'development', 'parks', 'ordinance', 'legislation', 'ballot measure', 'election (title)']",114.5,2025-08-05T19:10:44.324792,113322
https://www.thestranger.com/news/2024/12/20/79832816/ten-times-sara-nelson-engaged-in-the-performative-ideological-political-theater-she-decries,The Stranger (Web),"Ten Times Sara Nelson Engaged In The “Performative, Ideological” “Political Theater” She Decries Just Can't Get Enough?","Seattle City Council President Sara Nelson announced Wednesday morning her bid for re-election to the citywide Position 9 seat on Council. In her own self-mythos, Nelson portrays herself as a departure from “[y]ears of performative, ideological decisions” to “delivering real results – prioritizing safety, livability, and a city that works for everyone, not just political theater,” as she said in a press release. That schtick worked for her in 2021 when she ran as a referendum to the previous City Council, which had earned a reputation for taxing big business, protecting tenants, expanding workers' rights, and somewhat addressing the concerns raised by the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. But in just three years, Nelson transformed from the council’s political outsider to its ring leader. Now, after the reactive voting public overwhelmingly rejected her protégé, Tanya Woo, in favor of progressive Council Member Alexis Mercedes Rinck, Nelson now faces the challenge of defending numerous instances of her own “performative, ideological decisions” and “political theater” against an inevitable backlash candidate. That candidate has yet to emerge, but when they do, they’re welcome to reference this incomplete list of times Nelson made a little song and dance of her pro-cop, pro-business ideology. Who needs a study when you have vibes: In her first months on the City Council, Nelson introduced a resolution “supporting the development” of an incentives program that aimed to attract new officers to the Seattle Police Department (SPD). A resolution —or a non-binding action by the council—is by definition “performative.” And, in true “ideological” fashion, she didn’t let inconvenient information slow her largely symbolic crusade. The Seattle Department of Human Resources (SDHR) found inconclusive results regarding the efficacy of hiring bonuses. In particular, SPD did not see an increase in applicants even with the City dangling thousands in front of them at the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022. The department even appeared to caution against hiring bonuses as it could make current employees feel undervalued, leading to more departures. In an April 2022 committee meeting, Nelson encouraged her colleagues to dismiss the City’s findings — “This is one area where we don't need a consultant, really, to study the benefit of incentives,” she said. Instead, she pushed for immediate implementation of the policy, despite lacking evidence that it would effectively boost staffing levels. With little influence on the body, she couldn’t do much more than that. But lucky for her, she had a powerful ally in Mayor Bruce Harrell — at least when it came to cops. In July 2022, Harrell announced his plan to allow SPD to dole out hiring bonuses of up to $30,000 for lateral hires and $7,500 for new recruits. Later that summer, the City Council approved a hiring incentives pilot program. More than two years later, the City remains about 500 officers short of their decidedly unpragmatic goal of a force of 1,400 during a national staffing shortage. According to KOMO, despite the hiring bonuses, SPD lost 40 officers and gained only 15 in the first six months of 2024. Nonetheless, the council renewed the incentive program this year, even increasing the bonuses for lateral hires to $50,000. Nelson does a little interference as a treat: In July 2022, Nelson took a firm stance against former Council Member Andrew Lewis’s move to put Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) on the ballot next to an initiative for approval voting —a relatively untested system that seemed designed to favor moderates and establishment normies. Nelson, in a written statement and on the dais, accused the council of “interfering” with the will of the people in a rushed, opaque process. At the time, one could speculate that she made such a scene because she supported approval voting over RCV, but she insisted her vote against adding RCV to the ballot actually symbolized a vote for “good governance.” That principled stance crumbled when earlier this year lefties gathered enough signatures to put a tax on corporations to fund social housing on the ballot. Nelson folded, joining her council colleagues in supporting a pro-business alternative, drafted up in a suspicious process that could leave the council vulnerable to recalls. The curtain closed on Nelson’s outrage about good governance over council interference — No encore. An unsupportive supporting character: During budget negotiations in 2022, Nelson misrepresented the opinion of LaNesha DeBardelaben, the then president and CEO of Northwest African American Museum (NAAM), in order to further her own agenda. Nelson argued against an amendment to reroute $500,000 from the SPD advertising budget to NAAM for desperately needed repairs, claiming the DeBardelaben told her in a phone call that she was “disappointed” the funding would come at the expense of the cops. DeBardelaben told The Stranger that Nelson “egregiously misconstrued” their conversation. “I would never go against any amendment that invests $500,000 into the Northwest African American Museum,” DeBardelaben told The Stranger at the time. “... NAAM is a cultural gem for children, for elders, for families, for artists, for the constituents of all city council members, and for everyone.” And why would she misrepresent DeBardelaben? Nelson never answered The Stranger’s request for comment, but it seems pretty clear she used DeBardelaben to bolster a defense around her police maximalist agenda. Seems ideological to me! Grandstand: In the world of political theater, Nelson might deserve a Tony nomination for the following performance. In 2022, Nelson joined with former Council Member Alex Pedersen, another conservative outlier, in a symbolic vote against the 2023-2024 budget. This was despite the fact that the two received basically everything they wanted in the package, especially when it came to cops. The budget increased police funding from $355 million to $370 million, fully funded the Mayor’s ambition to hire 120 additional officers, and allocated $4 million in hiring bonuses. Since the budget’s passage was already assured,, “performative” seems an apt description of their little stunt. It drips with irony when you consider how conservatives like Nelson accused former Council Member Kshama Sawant of epitomizing “performative” and “ideological,” stances yet both Nelson and Pederson mirrored Sawant’s long standing practice of casting symbolic votes against the budget —something Pedersen himself had previously criticized. This one’s dedicated to the Downtown Seattle Association: After the State moved to recriminalize drugs in 2023, the City Council had no obligation to enshrine such a law on the City level, but Nelson, in partnership with Republican City Attorney Ann Davison, decided to anyway. She forced – and rushed – a mostly redundant virtual signal to carceral interests such as the Downtown Seattle Association (DSA), which was hungry to put drug users in jail where they would be, temporarily, out of sight and out of mind. The dramatic affair became a wedge issue in the 2023 campaign and may have been the nail in the coffin for Lewis’s re-election campaign. But did it solve so-called “street disorder?” Apparently not to the council’s own standard.his year, the new conservative majority marked new Stay Out Of Drug Area (SODA) zones to banish those charged with drug crimes in an effort to spread street disorder around so as not to offend Seattlites and tourists with the jarring sight of poverty and the public health crisis. Ritual sacrifice: In her first two years, Nelson had limited ability to do anything beyond the symbolic without help from the Mayor. But the tables turned after the 2023 election filled City Hall with her political allies who elected her council president over two more experienced members, Council Members Dan Strauss and Tammy Morales. Despite running in 2021 as a “pragmatic progressive” and leaning on similar branding in her re-election launch, Nelson’s first move as Council President did not fit the criteria for either “pragmatic” or “progressive.” She fired head of central staff Esther Handy, a highly unusual and shocking move that, while within her purview as president, flew in the face of pragmatism, according to City Hall insiders. And, those insiders couldn’t help but see a political motive in the firing. Handy, who served effectively under both progressive and conservative council presidents, still carried progressive stink on her from her time working at Progress Alliance and Puget Sound Sage. Nelson then replaced Handy with then Director of the Office of Economic and Revenue Forecasts (OERF), Ben Noble, who seemed to better align with her ideology as a proponent of fiscal austerity. Grab the popcorn: When conservatives bemoan “political theater,” they're often calling for civility, which usually boils down to keeping your volume down and avoiding personal attacks on colleagues. However, Nelson took part in one of the most scandalous personal attacks on Morales, which eventually led to her resignation. The council had to fill an open seat when former Council Member Teresa Mosqueda left the body for the County Council earlier this year. Disregarding the will of the voters, the council voted to appoint Tanya Woo, immediately following her loss to Morales. Morales took offense to the appointment, viewing it as a decision influenced by the majority’s corporate donors. She called the appointment a “foregone conclusion,” reducing the public process to little more than a puppet show. Adding to the insult, the council’s choice of someone who had actively campaigned against Morales felt like a deliberate slight—especially as Morales was already isolated as the sole member outside the conservative bloc. How I wish we had the full footage: Nelson's flair for the dramatic resurfaced in February 2024 when she couldn't help but accuse left-leaning public comment regulars, namely Stop The Sweeps, of exploiting the plight of refugee families to advance their own anti-surveillance agenda, as if the two issues couldn’t be directly and clearly connected. Her evidence? A few Instagram infographics urging people to sign up for public comment on Tuesday to support demands for housing and to oppose ShotSpotter. She called the show of solidarity “craven political opportunism” and limited public comment to just 20 minutes as punishment for the behavior. Surprise, the move backfired. Public commenters got pissed and staged an impromptu protest since Nelson denied them the official channels through which to levy concerns. The ordeal ended in six arrests and an hour and a half delay, meaning it would have actually saved time and some heat from the press to listen to her constituents rather than silence them. But the spectacle of publicly airing your personal beef with activists and eventually throwing them in jail is probably more satisfying. Cliffhanger: Despite her new power, Nelson’s biggest political endeavor of the year petered out without explanation, calling into question her characterization as a politician who “delivers real results” instead of engaging in virtue signals to her corporate overlords. Nelson embarked on a dramatic crusade against the newly established gig worker minimum wage earlier this year. But after a huge backlash from organized labor and ethical concerns that jeopardized her anti-worker majority, she gave up the fight and we haven’t heard a peep since. One might also characterize the ordeal as theater because she claimed to have conducted stakeholding with both sides of the debate. However, the group she cited as representing workers' interests was, in reality, an organization aligned with Uber's agenda. Cyberbully (2011) starring Emily Osment City Council: Most recently, her council came under fire after Morales announced her upcoming resignation in a scathing press release that accused her colleagues of bullying her, undermining her legislation, and eroding the institution as a whole. Addressing cultural issues like these are all of the council members’ responsibility, especially the council president. Although Nelson denies it, she failed to create an environment where everyone could reasonably do their job for their constituents. Instead, she allowed, without public pushback or apology, the City Council to openly scold Morales on the dais, stunts that reinforced to both Morales and the public the new power dynamics on the council. I’m sure I missed some of Nelson’s not-so-pragmatic and not-so-progressive moments during her tenure on the council and I’m almost positive we’ll see more theatrics before election day, but 10 examples seem like a good enough counter argument to her self-branding. Behind the scenes, politicos speculate Nelson will struggle to win this election. According to a poll by Northwest Progressive Institute conducted earlier this year, only 22% of likely voters approve of Nelson’s job performance and 32% said they disapproved. Her disapproval rate ranks even higher than Woo’s, who lost spectacularly to newcomer Rinck. As I reported following Rinck’s blowout win, Washington Community Alliance (WCA) data analyst Andrew Hong chalks up the pendulum swing to Rinck to a uniquely reactionary voting public that holds an anti-incumbent bias rather than progressive ideals newly awoken between the 2023 election and the 2024 election. Nelson’s consultant, Ben Anderstone, echoed Hong’s analysis in November, arguing voters who went center in 2023 picked Rinck in 2024 for “not-especially-ideological reasons.” “Seattle City Council never really stopped being unpopular,” Anderstone said previously. Anderstone, who did not want to speak directly about his client, said incumbents are not destined to lose, “but any incumbents need to effectively message around [voter’s] frustrations.” Nelson, in her press release announcement, acknowledged there’s still work for the council to do. ""Seattle isn’t where it needs to be yet, but we’ve come a long way. We’ve shifted from failed policies to approaches that are starting to work, and I’m committed to seeing those efforts through,” she said. ""By the end of this next term, I want our residents and people nationwide to know Seattle turned an impossible situation around by tackling tough issues and playing to its strengths.”",,"['mayor', 'city council', 'election', 'candidate', 'governance', 'harrell', 'bruce harrell', 'davison', 'ann davison', 'lewis', 'andrew lewis', 'morales', 'tammy morales', 'mosqueda', 'teresa mosqueda', 'nelson', 'sara nelson', 'pedersen', 'alex pedersen', 'sawant', 'kshama sawant', 'strauss', 'dan strauss', 'budget', 'housing', 'police', 'SPD', 'labor', 'workers', 'policy', 'development', 'referendum', 'legislation', 'nelson (title)', 'sara nelson (title)']",88.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.330744,14411

In case you haven’t been following the election so far (and with totalitarian takeover on our heels, we’d understand), here’s your chance to catch up. The filing deadlines are in early May, so there’s still time for some surprises, but even now, the election is shaping up to be an interesting one. This year, we have a mayor’s race featuring an embattled moderate incumbent who speaks the language of progressivism, but governs like a conservative. We’ve got a challenger for the District 9 City Council seat and a wide-open race in District 2. And finally, a City Attorney race, where anyone with an ounce of progressivism (or human decency) has been eager to unseat the incumbent from the moment she took office. We’ve got months before endorsement time, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t meet the candidates who have thrown their hats in the ring. Without further ado, here’s our quick breakdown of the local elections so far. Bruce Harrell, Seattle’s very own Chamber of Commerce sock puppet, finally has some challengers. The biggest name in the game so far is Katie Wilson: a street-fighting policy wonk who’s built a strong, progressive reputation actually winning battles for working people (raising the minimum wage, keeping transit affordable). When she launched her campaign, she told The Stranger about the kind of mayor she hopes to be: a coalition builder who’s able to reach across the aisle to find common goals, without diluting progressive, research-backed policies. She described herself as someone who’s willing to test new ideas and push forward on issues that have stagnated in this city for a decade. She’s untested in elected office—or even running in an election—but she urged voters to look at her record as a policy advocate. “I’ve spent the last 14 years of my career organizing, building powerful coalitions that win major victories for working people,” she told The Stranger. “And I’ve done all that from the outside. I would be happy to put my legislative record up against Bruce Harrell’s any day of the week.” Then there’s Ry Armstrong, an MLK Labor Delegate for SAG-AFTRA and an elected member of the Actor’s Equity Association, repping 50,000 actors from Texas to Hawaii. This is Armstrong’s second go at elected office. In 2023, they ran for Kshama Sawant’s City Council seat in District 3, and while progressives generally got wildly outspent by big business (and therefore creamed) in that election, Armstrong’s showing was particularly rough. Only 1.86 percent of the electorate (a total of 488 people) voted for Armstrong in that race. They’re proud of their big ideas, and a suite of progressive taxes to pay for them. Ry and Katie are joined in the race by a handful of other candidates, including: MAGA-y Rachael Savage, the Republican who is campaigning to block permanent supportive housing and arrest homeless addicts as means of recovery; and Joe Molloy, a homeless man who says he lost his housing last year due to an unsupported disability, and is running his grassroots campaign from Tent City 3. Seattle’s City Council President Sara Nelson has been on the council since 2022 and has been president since 2024. Her leadership has represented the Chamber of Commerce (and Amazon’s) bid to claim control of city government, so we’re very pleased to announce that she has a challenger. Her name is Dionne Foster, progressive policy wonk, and capital gains tax champion. Nelson, known for her right-leaning, business-first politics, might be in trouble, given the city’s enthusiastic support for progressive Alexis Mercedes Rinck in November, and the runaway success of February’s social housing initiative. Foster’s got the right ideas on housing and homelessness, but let’s be real, to quote a Reddit-er, if a rock ran against Nelson, some Seattleites would probably throw a vote its way just to avoid the “right-wing, inept millionaire” vibe. At the end of last year, Tammy Morales stepped down from her seat representing D2 on City Council, saying that the conservative, business-oriented City Council was a toxic, undemocratic environment. The council appointed Seattle Police Department crime prevention coordinator and long-time City Council hopeful Mark Solomon to hold down the seat until this year’s election, when it goes back to the people. So who’s gonna replace the progressive Morales? In the battle for D2’s vote, we start with Assistant City Attorney Eddie Lin, who primarily works with the Office of Housing. He describes himself as a champion of affordable housing, progressive revenue, and creating a city where “artists and bike messengers and baristas and educators can all afford to live here.” So far, he’s light on details for how he plans to do that, so we’ll be watching him closely. Then there’s Adonis Ducksworth, the Mayor’s senior transportation policy official and one of the architects of the 2024 transportation levy. He’s pushing a platform that combines safety, affordability, and... skate parks? The lifelong skateboarder knows how important public space is for kids (yay) but he also believes safety in D2 comes with more cops (boo). Like Lin, though, he hasn’t offered many other details yet. Eclipsing both of their fundraising, though, is a newer entrant: Takayo Minakami Ederer, a Columbia City-born real estate investor and karate instructor (and one of the first members of the women’s national karate team). Based on her early interviews, she’s largely running on a “public safety” platform—which, you guessed it, to her means more cops. She also acknowledges that we need more shelter beds, and advocates for a public-private partnership to make that happen. In our friendly neighborhood City Attorney showdown, Nathan Rouse, Rory O’Sullivan, and Erika Evans all have big ideas on how to fix Seattle’s broken justice system in contrast to incumbent Ann Davison—spoiler alert: most of them don’t involve locking up more people. Rouse, a public defender who’s done with Davison’s “tough-on-crime” charade, wants to bring back community court and stop prosecuting minor offenses like SODA and SOAP violations (which, fun fact, aren’t even being enforced right now). Meanwhile, Evans is focusing on serving up anti-Trump tea and advocating for harm reduction programs that actually help people instead of shoving them into jail. And then there’s O’Sullivan, who thinks the City Attorney’s office could use a little more compassion and a little less spectacle. So, get ready for a race that could decide whether Seattle stays stuck in the criminal justice quicksand or finally tries to pull itself out with actual solutions.

Despite several high profile departures during his tenure, Harrell has managed to avoid scandals as damaging as those that ended the careers of his predecessors—Ed Murray’s child sex abuse allegations and Jenny Durkan’s missing texts. But now, even in a historically precarious office, the interests that once sought to keep business-backed Harrell out of power, namely organized labor, aren’t currently scouting for a challenger in this election. It’s still early. While the powers that be seem cool with Harrell so far, there’s still time for a strong, pro-worker candidate to emerge before the filing deadline in May. Such a candidate's presence could call into question some progressives' newfound faith in Harrell and force him to answer for his record on not only labor, but housing, homelessness, and public safety. The candidates for the 2021 mayoral race fit neatly into the two familiar lanes of Seattle politics — Harrell represented business, while his opponent, then-City Council President Lorena González, represented labor. The same business interests that paid for Durkan and Murray’s campaigns coalesced around Harrell, spending almost $700,000 in support of him and another $650,000 against Gonzalez, according to the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission. And it seems Harrell has kept big business happy. “Mayor Bruce Harrell’s first term has left our community – including the employer community – feeling very optimistic!” says president and CEO of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce Rachel Smith. Smith cites the Chamber’s latest Index report, which found Seattle voters rated their quality of life and optimism higher than in previous reports. According to Smith, this marks the largest increase in these metrics in the report’s history. Remember, the Chamber doesn’t endorse candidates—they swore off directly organizing PACs after a PR fiasco in which Amazon nakedly tried to buy the 2019 election. But the same donors who supported the Chamber’s previous PACs still pool their money under different banners every year. Still, Smith says, the Chamber believes the increase in optimism “shows that Mayor Harrell’s leadership—leadership that is pragmatic, progressive, and focused on getting the basics right—is moving the city in the right direction.” Smith continues, “Coupled with managing the city budget, helping our community and businesses thrive by addressing public safety and drug use, and seizing opportunities that will benefit the city and region, we’re excited about working with him in 2025 and beyond. In other words, he’s kicking ass.” On the other hand, labor unions may have changed their tune from Harrell’s last election. In 2021, more than 20 progressive unions including UFCW 21 (now UFCW 3000), SEIU 775, Unite Here! Local 8, and the MLK Labor Council endorsed Gonzalez. Unions spent about $440,000 to support her and another $460,000 against Harrell through the Essential Workers For Lorena PAC, SEEC reports. But this time around, labor doesn’t seem so stoked to put up a million dollar fight against Harrell. The reason appears two fold—PACs have limited bandwidth to support candidates and organized labor thinks Harrell’s done an okay job. Next year, Seattle voters will weigh in on not only the Mayor’s race, but the City Attorney's race, two Citywide council seats, and now, the newly vacated District Two seat. Out of the two main, moneyed powers that decide local elections, big business has far superior buying power than labor. And so far, Progressive People Power (P3) PAC has yet to realize its promise of serving as a fundraising supplement to labor— most of its money in the recent election came from SEIU 775. Labor must choose its battles carefully. UFCW 3000 Secretary-Treasurer Joe Mizrahi says that right now, labor is much more focused on finding someone to run against Council President Sara Nelson, but he’s still interested in who might jump in the Mayor’s race in the coming months. So far, SEIU 775 Secretary-Treasurer Adam Glickman says that he hasn’t heard of labor scouting a challenger for Harrell. Labor’s been cozying up with Harrell for some time. In May, MLK Labor Council honored him with a “Labor Oscar” as reward for his “excellent leadership in reaching a deal with the Coalition of City Unions, his support of ‘first-in-the-nation’ workers rights laws in Seattle… his work to ensure that there was a landmark Labor Harmony Agreement on the Seattle Waterfront,” and his “leadership” in passing Building Emissions Performance Standards legislation that will help create hundreds of union jobs. “So we haven’t started an endorsement process yet in the Mayor’s race,” says Glickman. “But I can say that we really appreciate how the Mayor has repeatedly stood up for low wage workers against efforts by this council to undermine labor standards.” He referenced Nelson’s attempt to repeal the gig worker minimum wage and Council Member Joy Hollingsworth’s now-retracted bill to permanently enshrine a tip punishment system. While organized labor has credited Harrell with squashing the council’s attacks on workers’ rights, he never publicly opposed the gig worker minimum wage repeal. And he only called the sunset of the tip punishment system the “right thing for wage fairness” months after Hollingsworth had already withdrawn her bill. This is also the same Mayor who offered City workers a measly 1% raise, tried to strike human service cost-of-living adjustments, proposed cuts to the Office of Labor Standards, and faced accusations of trying to influence the City’s wage theft investigation at the Royal Esquire Club, a private social club where he served as board chair. But the lack of fire under labor’s ass to replace Harrell is not the only indication that Harrell has carved a wide lane for himself in his reelection campaign. Elected officials who previously endorsed Gonzalez have already come out in support of Harrell, including U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) Chair, and State Sen. Joe Nguyen, once dubbed the “AOC” of the Washington State Legislature. Nguyen did not respond to my request for comment. Jayapal calls Harrell a “great partner” to her and her office. She tells The Stranger: “He made a concerted effort to work with me on ensuring we bring the maximum amount possible of federal funding to Seattle for projects that have helped to build more affordable housing, support transportation and infrastructure, and to fight climate change. Mayor Harrell has also been a partner to me in pushing back on the MAGA extremist characterizations of Seattle, and helped me push the facts about how our city is a diverse, welcoming, and progressive place to live and work.” That’s not to say Harrell’s doesn’t have challenges. While he enjoys a relatively high approval rating—43% approval rating in a poll by the Northwest Progressive Institute—he’s also somewhat associated with Republican City Attorney Ann Davison and Nelson, as they ran on a pseudo joint slate in 2021 and have aligned on various issues in recent years. Neither Davison nor Nelson has nearly the popularity, scoring 27% and 22% approval rates respectively in the same poll. Davison has not announced her bid for reelection, so he may not have her baggage to deal with, but Nelson announced her's earlier this week. Harrell’s campaign did not respond when I asked if he plans to endorse Nelson. Additionally, Harrell’s pissed off other, less powerful interest groups in his tenure. Urbanists have criticized Harrell for his lackluster and slow-rolling Comprehensive Plan and lefties have criticized his zeal for sweeping the unhoused and his coziness with the cops. Those groups often align with labor, so if they can produce a strong challenger, the solid foundation Harrell seemed to roll out on may start to fracture.",,"['mayor', 'mayoral', 'city council', 'seattle politics', 'election', 'candidate', 'harrell', 'bruce harrell', 'davison', 'ann davison', 'nelson', 'sara nelson', 'gonzalez', 'budget', 'housing', 'homelessness', 'transportation', 'public safety', 'infrastructure', 'labor', 'union', 'workers', 'organizing', 'legislation', 'mayor (title)', 'harrell (title)']",63.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.306173,8018

I’ve returned to better weather. Today, it’ll be sunny with a balmy high of 81. Temperatures will drop to the high 50s tonight before heating back up tomorrow. Expect a slight chance of rain Thursday into Thursday night. Friday should be a pleasant, partly cloudy day in the low- to mid-70s. Dead Heat: Katie Wilson and Bruce Harrell are statistically tied in the mayor’s race a week before the primary election. It’s a limited sample (651) with a 4.1 percent margin of error, but still, this race is not a cakewalk for Harrell. He’ll have to fight to break the curse of the one-term mayor. His campaign seems to be betting on making Wilson, a quite normal woman, out to be a society-restructuring radical (after all, Stalin also said Seattle pizza was too expensive). Those awkward TikToks might come in handy. Welcome Back? Debora Juarez is back in her old City Council seat for the next 16 months, replacing Cathy Moore after her resignation earlier this month. For recent transplants and the generally forgetful, Juarez used to be council president. Mexican American and a member of the Blackfeet Nation, Juarez was the first Indigenous person in that role. In a press release, Chief Seattle Club, Seattle Indian Health Board, Seattle Indian Services Commission, and United Indians of All Tribes Foundation celebrated her appointment. “Debora Juarez has long embodied the power, resilience, and vision of Indigenous leadership,” the release read. While charmingly foul-mouthed, Juarez is a conservative who fits right into the current brat pack. She’s also known for being somewhat unpredictable. It’s interesting that she applied for the vacancy—she made clear that she was tired of the job when she decided not to run for reelection in 2023—but since throwing her hat into the ring, her appointment has been expected. Juarez received 7 votes. Alexis Mercedes Rinck voted for Nilu Jenks, a former candidate for District 5. Ferg Down: Washington voters think Governor Bob Ferguson sucks. A Monday Cascade PBS/Elway poll found his approval rating at the sixth month mark is the lowest for a Washington Governor since 1993. Of the 403 registered voters surveyed, 32 percent consider Ferguson to be doing a “good” or “excellent” job. That’s eight points lower than Gov. Inslee, 11 points below Christine Gregoire, and 20 points below Gary Locke at the same point in their first terms. Almost the same percentage of people (31 percent) think he’s doing a “poor” job; 22 percent rated his job performance as “fair.” Damn, dude. According to Cascade, people are angry that Ferguson is signing off on new taxes, that he’s cut spending, that he’s too focused on President Donald Trump’s administration, that he’s not focused enough on Trump, that he’s too in line with Democrats, and that he’s too moderate. You can’t please everyone all of the time, but Ferguson’s middling centerism seems to please nobody. Now to HMW for the latest on Denny Blaine. Thanks For Nothing: The City submitted its “abatement plan” for Denny Blaine Park on Monday evening. No one is thrilled about its idea to divide the already small beach into a nude area (closest to the water) and a clothed area (the vast majority of the park). “Zoning” Denny Blaine isn’t a new idea. Last year, the Parks Department proposed a nudity DMZ at the parking lot—much further back than the current abatement plan. When it was submitted for public comment, beach goers roundly rejected it because they felt it made a concession to neighbors they didn’t have to make. (This is where we remind you, dear reader, for the hundredth time, that nudity is legal in Seattle.) The city is also planning to increase the presence of park rangers and signage to the park. Sophie Amity Debs, who co-runs the park stewardship group Friends of Denny Blaine, told The Stranger that by cutting the space down to a tiny sliver of the park, the city is “not setting themselves up for success with having people respect and take these guidelines seriously.” This proposal isn’t the worst case scenario. “We are glad that it doesn't just outright ban nudity, because that was one of our big fears … and we are also glad that the enforcement mechanisms are via park rangers and not by SPD.” Back to me :)! Firefighters Saving a Rainforest: The human-caused Bear Gulch fire (first reported July 6, wonder how that started?) is creeping toward the Staircase area of Olympic National Park. The 1,100 acre fire is only 10 percent contained, the Seattle Times reports. Two hundred people, including firefighters, are assigned to this fire. Big Beautiful Electric Bills? Lawmakers say the cuts to renewable energy in President Donald Trump's Beautiful Bill will raise the price of electricity in Washington. As it turns out, massive public infrastructure projects are not optional or spontaneous. They’re important and planned decades in advance. Cities are growing, transmission lines are aging, and AI data centers are siphoning off our excess power to animate photos of dead grandparents at a time heatwaves are more likely to hit California and Washington simultaneously. We can’t just pause this work, cross our fingers and hope the power stays on. We’ll still have to pay for repairs, new energy projects, and extra power with our money. Seattle City Light CEO Dawn Lindell says people “can expect to see significant rate increases for probably the next 10 to 12 years.” The US Department of Energy did not respond to KUOW’s request for comment. Suspect Arrested For Shooting Lummi Nation Officer: Authorities arrested the 26-year-old suspect and Whatcom county resident for investigation of attempted murder yesterday afternoon. Early Monday morning, the officer responded to a call for a vehicle in a ditch in Lummi Nation west of Bellingham. The driver shot the officer and fled on foot. It’s unclear where and how the suspect was apprehended, but multiple law enforcement agencies were involved in the search. The officer was rushed into surgery. As of Monday afternoon, the officer was alive and receiving medical care. Northgate Shooter: Police say they're still searching for two suspects they say shot a man in the back of the head outside the Northgate Transit Center on Monday morning. The victim, 48, was in critical condition as of Monday afternoon. Over 60,000 Killed in Gaza Since October 7: Gaza’s ministry of health puts the total at 60,034. At least 62 have been killed since dawn, reports Al Jazeera, 19 of them aid seekers. Yesterday, two of the most-known Israeli rights groups (B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights —Israel) called the genocide a genocide for the first time. This morning, the UK announced that it would recognize a Palestinian state if Israel doesn't reach a ceasefire with Hamas by September. Shooter Killed Four in Midtown Manhattan: After much unverified online speculation that gunman Shane Tamura had targeted the investment company Blackstone, police say the three-page note found in his wallet indicates Tamura had likely targeted NFL headquarters. Police say Tamura claimed he suffered from CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, from playing football and accused the NFL of concealing the danger to players. Tamura shot himself in the chest. “Study my brain please,” police say he wrote. “I’m sorry.” CTE is a serious condition that increases the risk of suicide. It can only be diagnosed in an autopsy. One study of 2,000 former NFL players published in JAMA Neurology found 1 in 3 believed they had CTE. FIGHT! Paul Dans, a chief architect of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, is challenging Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican party’s most eligible bachelor. Dans, who looks like something bad happened to Mark Cuban (the Portrait of Mark Cuban?), is expected to formally announce his campaign in Charleston this Wednesday. Chris LaCivita, advisor to Sen. Graham’s campaign and co-manager of Trump’s presidential bid, ominously told the AP that Dans’ campaign would “end prematurely.” Thanks, Chris. Strange and threatening! Not Even Capitalism Safe From ICE Raids: The New York Times reports that work has slowed to a crawl at one Omaha, Nebraska meatpacking plant. Three weeks after ICE came to Glenn Valley Foods with a battering ram and a warrant for 107 workers, production is down by 70%. Half of the maintenance crew is being deported. About 50 workers are in ICE detention. Owner Gary Rohwer told the Times it was a “wipeout.” We don’t need the lens of capitalism to grasp the injustice of ICE abductions, but the bottom line is often the only thing that reaches Americans. *SCREECH*: Two whistleblowers have accused Emil Bove, former defense attorney for President Donald Trump, current top official at the Justice Department, and nominee for the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, of directing Justice Department staff to ignore federal court orders in the way of Trump’s mass deportation plans. A third says he lied to Senators during his confirmation hearing last month. The Senate is expected to vote on his appointment this week. A Tune for You: Thanks, MJ Lenderman. I love to do dishes to your music. Editor's Note: A previous version of this article said that people had speculated that the shooter in Manhattan had targeted Blackrock in the Midtown building.

A lifetime ago (in 2021), when Harrell first ran for mayor, he made a lot of big, substantive promises that voters seemed to believe: He pledged to build 1,000 new housing units in his first six months in office; he committed to changing the biased policing culture in SPD after the George Floyd protests; he said he didn’t believe “dispersal,” or sweeps, worked, and promised to take a “Housing First” approach to encampments around the city. Are we living in a utopia yet? In our endorsement meeting, we asked about his broken promises. We pointed out that he conducted more sweeps than his five predecessors combined. That he sunk years of municipal effort and energy into a Comprehensive Plan that won’t meet our housing needs. That he pandered to police with bruised egos, letting them become the militant thugs that we saw in Cal Anderson on Memorial Day weekend, but with higher salaries. And in an hour-long endorsement meeting, he didn’t answer for a single thing. In every case, the conditions in his city were someone else’s fault. Homelessness? The other cities in King County aren’t doing their part. The police that he says can take a hike if they don’t agree with his idea of good policing? Well, he told us, he doesn’t actually know what good policing is. They’re the experts, not him. Nothing was his responsibility. We understand why he would feel that way. Because the greatest sin of the Harrell Administration is what it hasn’t done. He’s a mayor without imagination, and with him at the helm, Seattle is a rudderless ship on a windless ocean. While tens of thousands of Seattleites are struggling to keep their head above water, he’s obsessing over penises spray painted on the overpasses, AI incubators, and digital advertising kiosks that profit private companies. There’s a perception that this race was Harrell’s from the start, so there was no use doing anything to stop him. But that’s not the case. In polling this spring, only 37 percent of Seattleites were happy with Harrell’s work in City Hall. Enough of Seattle is sick of the Harrell Show. Katie Wilson is Harrell’s opposite. If Harrell is all politics and no substance, Wilson is substance embodied. She’s been an organizer in Seattle for 15 years, and she’s built a career fighting for—and winning—campaigns like raising the minimum wage, protecting affordable transit, and building progressive revenue. Wilson’s campaign platform is clearly made by someone who’s used to making change in a system that’s built to fight against it. She has clear, step-by-step plans to build 4,000 units of shelter in four years, to streamline access to addiction and mental health treatment, and to build $1 billion worth of union-built affordable housing. Harrell made promises. Wilson actually intends to keep hers. And she knows how to do it. In our meeting, one question best captured the difference between Wilson and Harrell. We asked about the FIFA World Cup coming to Seattle in 2026. When Seattle hosted the MLB All-Star game in 2023, the city swept any encampments in the area out of sight. Surely, next year, Seattle’s mayor would have to field a fair amount of outside pressure to make visible homelessness invisible while the world’s eyes are on us. How would they respond? We gave Harrell two chances to answer the question, and he never did. Instead, he ranted about how our surrounding cities aren’t building as much shelter as we are, how he has to prioritize small businesses, said it was his responsibility to revitalize downtown, and reminded us that he signed an ordinance to make Seattle a Human Rights City. Then he turned to the other candidates, and said: “How dare you talk about the values I’ve been a part of for the last 16 years.” Wilson, meanwhile, rejected the premise of the question entirely. Not because she didn’t want to answer it, but because she had a plan to stand up enough shelter in the first six months of her term—between tiny home villages, faith communities, and vacancies throughout the city—to make the question irrelevant. “Let’s get people inside in time for the World Cup,” she said. See that, Harrell? No excuses, just a goal, a plan, and a timeline. This is why Wilson has our vote. She sees people that are struggling and thinks about solutions, not optics. She obviously, palpably gives a damn about people, and that drives her to act, not just talk. While we were writing this endorsement, Zohran Mamdani, a Democratic Socialist with a people-first platform, wiped the floor with an establishment Democrat in New York City’s primary. Mamdani’s win is proof that people can show up in droves and throw decades of political tradition in the trash and choose something better. And that to accomplish such a feat, being a hell of a politician with a great personality helps a fuckton. Wilson has the platform. What she doesn’t have is the energy. She’s quiet. She’s policy minded. She makes deeply awkward TikToks. But she knows her shit and she cares. Wilson doesn’t pull out the tear-jerking stump speech or throw down with her opposition. And while we trust that your vote will get her through the primary, we need her to throw down. Show everyone that Harrell’s empty, that he’s unelectable this time. This city wants to see that. And it wants change. Do what you need to do to give the people what they want. Show us your spine is as sturdy as that platform. We know it’s in you. Now reader, we know that Wilson isn’t the only one making a run for Harrell’s graffiti-less office (and Joe Molloy, we hope to see you run for City Council, where your good heart, and brains, would be appreciated), but she’s the only one who has the secret sauce we need to see: one-part great ideas, one-part the knowledge and experience to pull them off, two-parts the willingness to leave an easier life as an organizer to serve the city when she thinks she’s needed. We just need her to add a little heat to that sauce. If you’re still wondering if dethroning Harrell is the right decision, we’ll leave you with one more detail. For the last year, members of his administration have talked about the misogyny, bullying, and literal chest beating in City Hall since he’s been in office. We had Mayor Harrell in our conference room for just under an hour, and in that time, he did nothing to convince us that his reputation was not a completely accurate characterization. We lost count of how many times he pounded his fist onto the table and stomped his feet, and we had to shout over him more than once to stop him from yelling at other candidates. Harrell somehow made Joe Mallahan look good (well, not that good). He took control of the room—not the way a charismatic speaker captures an audience, but the way your angry uncle sucks the air out of the room on Thanksgiving. Our civic self-esteem cannot be so low. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that we need a strong, bullish personality at the helm of our city to combat everything that Trump promises to rain on us in the next three and a half years. Mayor Harrell has shown us, time and time again, that all he’s going to do is bully Seattle, not Trump. And we can’t afford that. Wilson may be quiet. But she has values. Seattle has a time-honored tradition of producing one-term mayors. Let’s make Harrell one of them. Vote Wilson.",,"['mayor', 'city council', 'municipal', 'harrell', 'bruce harrell', 'wilson', 'katie wilson', 'mallahan', 'joe mallahan', 'molloy', 'joe molloy', 'housing', 'homelessness', 'police', 'SPD', 'union', 'policy', 'ordinance', 'mayor (title)', 'wilson (title)', 'katie wilson (title)']",49.5,2025-08-05T19:10:44.342967,7334

The poll, based on interviews with 651 likely primary voters, found that when voters were given the information in the King County Voters Pamphlet, 35 percent said they would vote for Wilson, compared to 33 percent that said they would vote for Harrell. When they simulated a general election with the two candidates, 43 percent went for Wilson, and only 39 percent for Harrell. The margin of error for this poll is 4.1 percent, so statistically, the two candidates are tied. What might be more important, though, is where each candidate has room to grow. Andrew Villeneuve, the executive director of NPI, sees Harrell’s incumbency as a disadvantage in this election. Seattle is always looking for fresh blood (we haven’t reelected a mayor since Greg Nichols in 2005), and this year is no different. Harrell’s approval rating is 35 percent, but his disapproval rating is a whopping 44 percent. Wilson’s disapproval rating is only 18 percent, and 48 percent of the respondents didn’t have an opinion on her, which means she has so much more room to win over voters in the general election. Typically an incumbent would hope to be close to 50 percent at this point in the race, Villeneuve said in a press conference Monday morning. ""[Harrell] is in a race for his political life,"" Villeneuve said. ""This is one of the most exciting mayoral races I've ever seen."" Harrell’s campaign has clearly noticed how tight the race is, and they’re starting to go negative. A press release from the campaign two weeks ago claimed that Wilson was “flip flopped” because she declined to endorse Kshama Sawant’s run for Congress, and claimed she was trying to “mislead Seattle voters and make her extreme views palatable to the general public.” And last week, they sent out a mailer that went after her previous endorsements of Sawant and her support for plans to cut police budgets. And while, thanks to the Democracy Voucher Programs spending limits, they’re tied in fundraising, the pro-Harrell PAC’s fundraising has already passed $275,000. Wilson has campaigned with a huge focus on affordability: of rent, childcare, and a slice of pizza. The Stranger asked NPI’s Villeneuve if the results showed that her affordability-focused messaging was resonating with voters. “Yes, focusing on affordability has definitely helped Katie,” he said. He noted that a handful of voters mentioned affordability as one of the central reasons they would vote for her, “but campaigning on lowering Seattleites' costs is not the only reason why she's competing well right now. Wilson's supporters say she brings good political instincts to the table and has a track record of getting results.” Villeneuve pointed to one person who was surveyed—a Black woman between 39 and 49 years old with a graduate degree who lives in Georgetown—as a good example of Wilson’s appeal. ""Katie has worked with so many community partners and leaders,” she wrote. “She is a critical thinker and she is able [to] make a plan and mitigate harm. She is trustworthy because her actions and words match. She understands the challenges the city has and the opportunities to utilize existing resources to help communities and she is thoughtful about progressive revenue. She applies a racial equity lens and she is a strong advocate for renters, anti-displacement, inclusive zoning, [good] jobs and reliable transportation. She knows these investments lead to real public safety... She won't lead with hostility and that tone will improve jobs for city staff."" When reached for comment, the Harrell campaign pointed to “tariff-driven inflation impacting household budgets” as one of his headwinds in the campaign, and emphasized the same notes that are in his negative mailers: Wilson's previous endorsement of Sawant, her support for cutting police budgets, and her opposition to sweeps. “We knew this would be a challenging race,” Harrell said. Wilson took an understated victory lap. “This poll shows what I and our hundreds of campaign volunteers already know from talking with voters across the city: so many people are ready for change,” Wilson told The Stranger. “They know we can’t afford another four years of visionless leadership that puts wealthy interests ahead of everyday working people.” Editor's Note: This story has been updated to include comment from the Harrell Campaign.",,"['mayor', 'mayoral', 'election', 'candidate', 'harrell', 'bruce harrell', 'wilson', 'katie wilson', 'sawant', 'kshama sawant', 'transportation', 'zoning', 'public safety', 'police', 'harrell (title)', 'wilson (title)', 'katie wilson (title)']",42.5,2025-08-05T19:10:44.306173,4673

JK, JK. It's not all bad. It's Primary Election Night, babies, and the future actually looks bright-ish! Mayoral candidate Katie Wilson is giving Mayor Bruce Harrell a run for his money (literally), and Dionne Foster is neck-and-neck with conservative City Council President Sara Nelson. There is hope! While it's impossible to know what will shake out once all the ballots are counted, we're going to do our best—tonight, members of the Stranger Election Control Board are charging into the city to pop into election parties all over town. We're going to sneak snacks, eavesdrop, and see how candidates react to the first wave of tonight’s results, so stay tuned to this liveblog to follow along! Speaking of results, the first batch should drop tonight shortly after 8 p.m. Which means... you still have time to vote! Is your ballot still sitting in the pile of old mail, unopened and ignored? Just fill it out (here’s our cheat sheet), and drop it in a ballot box by 8 p.m.! If you never received a ballot, lost your ballot, or forgot to register before the ballots were mailed, you can vote in person at one of King County's election sites, which, in Seattle, is at the Lumen Field Events Center. Also open until 8 p.m. As of 4 p.m., 22 percent of registered voters in King County have returned their ballots. Don’t be another statistic. VOTE! See you later tonight for fun, mischief, and maybe some crying. All photos by the Stranger Election Control Board unless otherwise noted. There Is Not Very Much Parking in Leschi, and Harrell's Base Is Going to Hate That6:45 p.m. So far it's all boats and BMWs. We did not get invited to Bruce Harrell’s election night party in Leschi. His campaign never even responded to our inquiries! Fear not. Little birdies told us where it is. This is why we are 30 minutes early. Upon arriving, we had to parallel park into one of the only available spots. It took us three tries. We already hate this, and unless there is a secret special parking lot for Bruce’s guests who *definitely* all drove to this, then they are going to hate it too. Anyway, we are now sitting on a Leschi dock, preparing for the inevitability that Harrell tells us to high-tail it out of here without even a single crab cake (based on the venue, we assume there will be crab cakes). A pontoon boat full of tan blonde people is singing happy birthday to one of their ilk. We are watching the staff at Harrell’s party place cups on tables. Now we have moved to Lakeside Ave to scope the front entrance. We just saw three BMWs drive by in a row. Are these donors? We will late a little longer. Hope we at least get a crab cake. You're Voting, You're Really Voting!6:25 p.m. Cute nail polish makes voting more fun. A couple of hours ago, 22 percent of registered voters in King County had returned their ballots. Now, as of 6 p.m., the King County Elections office is reporting that 24 percent of y'all have done your civic duty. Will we beat last year's sad 41 percent? We believe in you, Seattle! Go! Vote! Ballot boxes and in-person voting centers are open until 8 p.m.! What We’re Watching in City Council Position 96:15 p.m. This race is keeping us on our toes. Recent polling put City Council President Sara Nelson and policy wonk Dionne Foster in another statistical tie, but the vast majority of voters were undecided. “It could break pretty aggressively in one way or the other,” said political consultant Stephen Paolini. “I don't think anyone has a good pulse on how that's going to break.” What We’re Watching in the Mayor’s Race6:10 p.m. Katie Wilson’s campaign has been picking up speed, especially in the last month. New polling showed her statistically tied with Mayor Bruce Harrell at the end of last month, and fundraising-wise, they’re neck and neck (about half a million each). The big difference between the two right now is PAC money. Bruce Harrell for Seattle’s Future has already spent more than $180,000 on his behalf. So what does a good night for Wilson look like tonight? According to Stephen Paolini, a local political consultant, it’d look like Harrell getting less than 45 percent of the vote, with her in second place. “I’m expecting her to actually have a really good night,” he says. No One Is Dancing at Jeanie Chunn's Othello Park Primary Dance Party5:56 p.m. Dancers TK. It’s still early, and maybe everyone is busy eating the fare from Soul Fusion, but the DJ in the park is bumping sick beats (remixes of ""Jessie’s Girl"" by Rick Springfield, ""Hot N Cold"" by Katy Perry, ""September"" by Earth, With & Fire, ""Danza Kuduro"" by Don Omar, ""Can't Hold Us"" by Macklemore, ""Baby Got Back"" by Sir Mix-a-Lot) to an audience of no groovers. But people are chowing down and playing corn hole. Maybe things will heat up as we get closer to ballot drop. We have yet to see Jeanie, but that’s because we are hungry and want Soul Fusion just like everyone else. The best election party food so far. 📌 Let's get ready to crumble!!!! ...under the crushing weight of democracy's corpse. JK, JK. It's not all bad. It's Primary Election Night, babies, and the future actually looks bright-ish! Mayoral candidate Katie Wilson is giving Mayor Bruce Harrell a run for his money (literally), and Dionne Foster is neck-and-neck with conservative City Council President Sara Nelson. There is hope! While it's impossible to know what will shake out once all the ballots are counted, we're going to do our best—tonight, members of the Stranger Election Control Board are charging into the city to pop into election parties all over town. We're going to sneak snacks, eavesdrop, and see how candidates react to the first wave of tonight’s results, so stay tuned to this liveblog to follow along! Speaking of results, the first batch should drop tonight shortly after 8 p.m. Which means... you still have time to vote! Is your ballot still sitting in the pile of old mail, unopened and ignored? Just fill it out (here’s our cheat sheet), and drop it in a ballot box by 8 p.m.! If you never received a ballot, lost your ballot, or forgot to register before the ballots were mailed, you can vote in person at one of King County's election sites, which, in Seattle, is at the Lumen Field Events Center. Also open until 8 p.m. As of 4 p.m., 22 percent of registered voters in King County have returned their ballots. Don’t be another statistic. VOTE! See you later tonight for fun, mischief, and maybe some crying. All photos by the Stranger Election Control Board unless otherwise noted. We did not get invited to Bruce Harrell’s election night party in Leschi. His campaign never even responded to our inquiries! Fear not. Little birdies told us where it is. This is why we are 30 minutes early. Upon arriving, we had to parallel park into one of the only available spots. It took us three tries. We already hate this, and unless there is a secret special parking lot for Bruce’s guests who *definitely* all drove to this, then they are going to hate it too. Anyway, we are now sitting on a Leschi dock, preparing for the inevitability that Harrell tells us to high-tail it out of here without even a single crab cake (based on the venue, we assume there will be crab cakes). A pontoon boat full of tan blonde people is singing happy birthday to one of their ilk. We are watching the staff at Harrell’s party place cups on tables. Now we have moved to Lakeside Ave to scope the front entrance. We just saw three BMWs drive by in a row. Are these donors? We will late a little longer. A couple of hours ago, 22 percent of registered voters in King County had returned their ballots. Now, as of 6 p.m., the King County Elections office is reporting that 24 percent of y'all have done your civic duty. Will we beat last year's sad 41 percent? We believe in you, Seattle! Go! Vote! Ballot boxes and in-person voting centers are open until 8 p.m.! This race is keeping us on our toes. Recent polling put City Council President Sara Nelson and policy wonk Dionne Foster in another statistical tie, but the vast majority of voters were undecided. “It could break pretty aggressively in one way or the other,” said political consultant Stephen Paolini. “I don't think anyone has a good pulse on how that's going to break.” Katie Wilson’s campaign has been picking up speed, especially in the last month. New polling showed her statistically tied with Mayor Bruce Harrell at the end of last month, and fundraising-wise, they’re neck and neck (about half a million each). The big difference between the two right now is PAC money. Bruce Harrell for Seattle’s Future has already spent more than $180,000 on his behalf. So what does a good night for Wilson look like tonight? According to Stephen Paolini, a local political consultant, it’d look like Harrell getting less than 45 percent of the vote, with her in second place. “I’m expecting her to actually have a really good night,” he says.

Today is our last day in the 80s for a while. We’ll slide into the weekend with some perfect Seattle weather in the high 70s, and it’ll last through the first half of next week. Let’s do the news. Who Wants to Build Trump’s Fighter Jets Anyway? More than 3,200 machinists in Boeing’s St. Louis-based defense division are threatening to walk off the job on Sunday and halt production of their military planes. Boeing, who totally isn’t worried about their stock prices, reminded Seattle Times readers that this was just a tenth of the size of last year’s strike in the PNW that tanked their productivity. They also want you to know that this won’t affect production of Trump’s vanity project, the F-47, which is their newest defense contract. Out-of-State PAC Money Rolls into City Council Race: Stranger Staff Writer Nathalie Graham reported yesterday that the National Association of Realtors, a Chicago-based political action committee, already spent nearly $70,000 on mailers for Council President Sara Nelson’s bid to stay on the Seattle City Council. That adds to the more than $400,000 war chest Nelson already has for her campaign to hang onto her council seat. To counter that out-of-state spending, her best competition, Dionne Foster, got some support from Seattle’s progressive PAC, helpfully named Progressive People Power (or P3). As a rule, they don’t get involved until the general, but the Nelson/Foster race got them in the mix early. Toe-to-Toe: New polling from the Northwest Progressive Institute (NPI) showed Foster four points ahead of Nelson with likely voters, once they were provided the information in the voter pamphlet. Those four points are within the margin of error, so statistically, it’s a tie. But with Nelson’s record-low approval ratings, I’d bet she’s feeling nervous. Meanwhile, in the other city-wide council seat, NPI polling found that Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck looks likely to win reelection pretty comfortably, despite the Seattle Times’ refusal to endorse in that race because, as they said, while the candidates were “an interesting group of hopefuls” (a sitting council person) and “very nice,” none of them met their criteria for an endorsement (good). It seems like Republican candidate Rachael Savage sees the writing on the wall, so she’s taking her whole campaign message and turning it into a citizen initiative to ban homeless camping in Seattle and force people to choose between treatment and arrest. The Shield Tax Is Working Its Way Through Council: Yesterday, City Council heard public comment and voted on 17 amendments for the progressive tax code overhaul called the Shield Initiative. Introduced by Councilmember Rinck and Mayor Bruce Harrell, it would eliminate or lower the B&O tax for small businesses, raise the tax for Seattle’s 2,300 highest-grossing companies, and raise $90 million in the process. Public commenters overwhelmingly spoke in support of the bill (the only exceptions being the extremely pro-business Downtown Seattle Association and the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce). A huge number of people working on food access showed up, because under a Trump administration, this initiative could literally be the difference between people eating and not. Council should vote on the full initiative on Monday, just shy of the deadline to get it on the November ballot, and let the people decide. Nuclear Fusion in Everett? The Everett-based company, Helion, announced that it broke ground on the world’s first nuclear fusion power plant. The only problem? It’s not clear if they’ve actually figured out how to turn fusion into power. Maybe that’s a problem for Future Helion. Fernando’s Going Home, for Now: Fernando Alves Rocha, the theater manager at Juanita High School in Kirkland, is expected to be released on a $10,000 bond. He’s been in the Northwest ICE Processing Center for nearly two weeks after immigration officers arrested him in his driveway. They claim he overstayed his tourist visa in 2018. His attorney told KUOW that Rocha filed an asylum application a day before his visa expired in 2018, and that he’s had a valid work permit since his asylum application has been pending. Our Hometown Counterterrorist: Remember when Joe Kent, Trump’s “Young Gun,” was running for Congress in Southern Washington? Well, the former Green Beret and friend to White Supremacists was just confirmed by the Senate as the country’s top counter terrorism official. Trump’s Tariff Tantrums: The deadline for tariffs to come crashing down on every one of our trade partners is tomorrow, so there’s a lot of tariff news: Trump has escalated the fight with Brazil, raising their tariffs to 50 percent and slapping sanctions on the judge that’s investigating Bolsonaro (because dictators look after their own, sometimes); the Administration settled on a 15 percent tariff rate with South Korea; and countries are agreeing to buy more US fuel than they need just to get Trump off their back. And then there’s Canada. Trump said this morning that it would be “very hard” to make a trade deal with our neighbors to the north if they dared to follow in the UK and France’s footsteps and recognize Palestine’s statehood. As a reminder, 147 out of 193 UN member states recognize Palestinian statehood. We’re the problem. Gazans Are Starving and Capitalism Still Rules: Most Gazans depend on aid drops for sustenance at this point, but there are still some operating markets, selling limited produce, pantry staples, and some looted aid package materials. There, a kilo of sugar is more than $100. Baby formula is $51. Let me say that again. Baby formula for starving infants is $51. This Is Fascism: Another Ivy League university has paid off the Trump administration in exchange for being allowed to exist. Brown University agreed to make $50 million in payments to state workforce development programs over the next 10 years, and said they would comply with the Trump administration’s overall ideology, including bans on transgender athletes participating in collegiate sports. Because our federal government is the mob now? Uh Oh, I Agree with the NYT Editorial Board: The New York Times editorial board took a shot at the Supreme Court this week, calling them out for their lack of transparency around their rulings about the Trump administration: Federal judges are not elected by the public. Nor are they supposed to make decisions based on their ideological preferences. Our political system instead vests them with the power to decide whether the president, Congress and other lawmakers are enacting policies that are consistent with previous laws, court rulings and, above all, the Constitution. For these reasons, the credibility of judges depends on their ability to offer public explanation for the legal basis of their decisions…Clear explanation is especially important for the Supreme Court, which sets national rules that lower courts must follow. When the court fails to make these rules clear, confusion can set in. The current Supreme Court is creating precisely this problem by issuing many important rulings as brief, unsigned orders on its so-called emergency docket. On this docket (also known as the shadow docket), the votes among the nine justices are not public, and the majorities typically offer little explanation for their decisions. Yet the justices have used the emergency docket this year to hand down a series of rulings allowing President Trump to expand executive power and alter the structure of government. Preach. I’ll be at the Death Cab for Cutie anniversary show tonight, and Nation of Language is opening for them.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/02/12/79918008/legislative-sausage-making-at-its-finest-spds-blast-balls-are-back,The Stranger (Web),“Legislative sausage-making at its finest”: SPD’s Blast Balls are Back Just Can't Get Enough?,"Yesterday, the City Council voted six to three to reinstate the Seattle Police Department’s ability to use blast balls, a controversial “less lethal” form of crowd control, on protestors. Mayor Bruce Harrell’s office introduced the bill in October 2024. Councilmembers Cathy Moore, Alexis Mercedes Rinck, and Joy Hollingsworth opposed it, while Council President Sara Nelson and Councilmembers Maritza Rivera, Rob Saka, Mark Solomon, Dan Strauss, and Bob Kettle voted in favor. The use of blast balls was banned by their predecessors in June 2020, in response to the brutal consequences of their use on protestors against police brutality that same summer. However, that ban was never really upheld. Instead, it was put on hold by U.S. District Judge James Robart, who oversees the federal consent decree that the Seattle Police Department has been operating under since 2012. At the time, the Department of Justice and then-SPD Chief Carmen Best argued that not having “less lethal” options would force police to use, uh, more lethal options. “Christina Fogg, an Assistant U.S. Attorney, argued on Friday that without blast balls, pepper spray and other weapons banned by the Council, police would have only ‘batons, tasers and handguns,’” wrote the Seattle Times’ David Gutman, in an article on Robart’s order to block the ban. Robart’s basically said, “Yeah, totally,” instead of what a normal person would say, which is: “Why the fuck would you shoot someone who is unarmed and exercising their First Amendment right to protest, even if they were about to smash a window or sock a cop? Why would you even suggest that!?” And perhaps even: “With that attitude, why the hell do we allow you absolute psychopaths to carry deadly weapons?” A quite frankly upsetting number of sitting councilmembers were also in the, “Yeah, totally,” camp yesterday, but I suppose that’s to be expected these days. Anyway, I won’t bore you with the wonky details, but basically the ban got trapped in legal limbo and never actually took effect. All this time, we’ve been operating under SPD’s existing interim crowd control policies. Indeed, the vote yesterday had a lot to do with getting out from under the consent decree, as nailing down a permanent crowd control policy was one of Robart’s last asks. Given that Mayor Bruce Harrell has made it abundantly clear that he wants to see the consent decree lifted during his time in office, and given the close political alignment he enjoys with the majority of the council, this was pretty much always going to pass. Weirdly, Councilmember Cathy Moore, who shares plenty of politics with Harrell, joined with Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck —who shares politics with precisely none of her colleagues or the mayor— to oppose the bill in its current form. Both spoke to its flaws, and both offered amendments attempting to soften the blow. “I understand the need to move us out of the consent decree, I absolutely support the need to get out of the consent decree, but as I said the first time, we have to get it right,” Moore said. “And I don’t know that the court is necessarily going to believe or find that this is an adequate policy. It’s deeply flawed.” Be that as it may, it’s just that SPD hasn’t had the opportunity, motivation, or explicit permission from the council to use them. Now they do. The important question is, will they? Based on a close read of the new ordinance, there’s no way of knowing. The big takeaway here is that this new “regulation” does very little to actually regulate the behavior of cops when it comes to blast balls, tear gas, pepper spray, and so on. While the bill is packed with very serious-sounding regulations— including a rock-solid, totally enforceable pinky promise, “police use of force for crowd control shall be objectively reasonable, necessary, and proportional to the threat presented” — at the end of the day, when and how to use these incredibly dangerous “less lethal” weapons is left almost entirely up to SPD. Better yet, a lot of it has to do with what an officer thinks is happening from moment to moment. Generally, an SPD Incident Commander or supervisor may still approve anything besides blast balls and tear gas. Once approved, officers must not deploy said tools “unless specific facts and circumstances are occurring or about to occur that create an imminent risk of physical injury to any person or significant property damage.” Nothing further on what those specific facts and circumstances are is included in the bill. For tear gas specifically, the new crowd control bill prohibits it except in situations essentially amounting to a riot (the definition of which is a whole nebula of its own) or a hostage scenario and requires a Mayoral proclamation of civil emergency. As for blast balls, they also carry the same Mayoral proclamation requirement, though they can be used for regular old crowd control, provided, of course, that “specific facts and circumstances establish an imminent threat of violence against persons or significant property damage.” Cops are already supposed to reserve force, and especially deadly force for only situations where it is absolutely necessary, typically in response to immediate threats to their own or a victim’s life. Sounds great, but if their colleagues in Minnesota did that, SPD wouldn’t have had a reason to deploy all the blast balls they deployed in 2020 in the first place. God’s green internet wouldn’t be riddled with videos of innocent people getting shot in the back, beaten to death while they scream for their mother, or lit up while crawling along the ground on their stomach, hands clearly in view. The issue with so much of our regulation around policing is that we’re trusting people who have demonstrated incredibly poor judgment to make important, life-or-death judgment calls. During public comment, Matt Offenbacher, who described himself as a Capitol Hill resident and SODO business owner, brought up the cautionary tale of Captain Steve Strand. “Among other things, he drove his unmarked police car into a crowd of nonviolent climate protestors,” Offenbacher said. “I was one of those protestors, so I can tell you firsthand how shockingly unhinged Captain Strand’s behavior seemed. From the moment he arrived on the scene, his rage led him to escalate his response, greatly increasing the potential for harm and injury.” Noting that his final words from above were not his own opinion, but the actual findings of the Office of Police Accountability, Offenbacher concluded by saying, “I bring Captain Strand to your attention today as a warning that no matter what policies and safeguards you write, councilmembers, if you reauthorize the SPD’s use of less lethal weapons, they will use them and there will be a certain number of officers who, in the heat of the moment, will let their own feelings, their politics, their rage dictate their actions.” Kettle, the bill’s sponsor, later said that “training, training, training” would be key to reincorporating less lethal weaponry in a way that doesn’t harm innocent Seattleites — a handwave if I’ve ever heard one. We have yet to train our way out of what I consider to be the root cause of the rage Offenbacher highlighted, which is that too many police officers see the people they’re supposed to be protecting and serving during protests — the protestors, to be clear, along with everyone else in the vicinity — as the enemy. While I realize this echoes a popular protest slogan, it’s also concerning that so many of the statutes in this “less lethal” weapons policy use imminent property damage as a trigger for the deployment of pretty serious levels of force. Sure, if someone is visibly attempting to maim or kill someone else, and you can prevent it by tossing a blast ball under their feet, I can see an argument for that. But for fuck’s sake, if you’re debating the merits of whether cops should be allowed to cause severe harm and long-term psychological damage to a person — plus all the people around that person — over a plate glass window, what are you even doing on that dias? Perhaps the one thing in this ordinance that could have provided a hard consequence for making the wrong judgment call was Rinck’s Amendment I, which would have created a private right of action to the tune of $10,000 in the event of injury resulting from improper use of blast balls. That right would be denied to anyone who “in the judgment of a reasonable officer, commits a criminal offense at or immediately prior to the use of less lethal force.” Kettle, the bill’s sponsor, was not sold on the idea. “One of the things on this is that there’s already processes available to individuals who felt that they’ve been injured by anybody in the city, nevermind the Seattle Police Department,” he said, “Those processes get the job done, and we should not add to that with this private right of action.” He’s partially right. The city already had to pay $10 million to people injured by less lethal weapons during the 2020 protests. Not that that did anything to steer cops away from such tools. At a Feb. 8 anti-Trump protest on Alki Beach, officers threatened to tear gas and pepper spray protestors who had blocked Alki Ave. Whether or not you believe additional financial penalties would put cops on their best behavior, the amendment went down in flames, with only Rinck and Moore voting in favor. Moore did secure a couple of small concessions. Amendment E added a new recital basically putting down on record that blast balls have a “demonstrated track record” of hurting people who were doing nothing wrong. Amendment D ended up being the only specific, tangible restriction on the use of blast balls, mandating that they only be thrown underhand and away from people, even if it did still include a carveout allowing officers to “deploy blast balls overhand and near a person” so long as they deemed it “reasonable, necessary, and proportional to address immediate threats to life safety.” Silver linings aside, what we are left with is a bill that gives our extremely cop-friendly mayor control over when and how cops are allowed to quell unrest. But once he’s decided a protest is fair game and declared a state of emergency, it’s entirely up to the cops to decide when it’s appropriate to employ “less lethal” weapons. Do not be fooled, nothing in this bill prevents them from doing what they did last time around: shooting first and covering ass later. All they have to do is say that someone was about to do something very bad, an excuse cops have definitely never used to get away with bullshit before. As has become so common under the current Mayor and Council, we have endured yet another situation where people in power quibble on and on and on about something that is ultimately symbolic, with the resulting vote giving SPOG and/or the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce something damn close to whatever they asked for in the beginning. Or, as Saka put it in his closing remarks, “legislative sausage-making at its finest.” I think I’m full.",,"['mayor', 'mayoral', 'city council', 'councilmember', 'harrell', 'bruce harrell', 'nelson', 'sara nelson', 'strauss', 'dan strauss', 'police', 'SPD', 'policy', 'ordinance', 'SPD (title)']",37.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.344963,11070
https://www.thestranger.com/news/2024/12/17/79829089/landlord-lobby-wishlist-leaked,The Stranger (Web),Landlord Lobby Wishlist Leaked Just Can't Get Enough?,"The Housing Development Consortium (HDC), a powerful landlord lobby of united nonprofit and for-profit developers, is working with Mayor Bruce Harrell and the City Council on their legislative wishlist, according to a slide deck sent to The Stranger. The landlord lobby’s long-rumored “policy matrix,” seeks to significantly limit the protection of the winter and school year eviction moratoriums, raise the $10 late fee cap to $50, repeal the 2019 roommate law, cut the six-month rental increase notice requirement to four months and just two in some cases, and implement other policies that favor landlords. “Here in Seattle, providers are grappling with escalating operational costs, rising insurance premiums, and mounting arrears from the pandemic’s lingering economic impacts,” says HDC Executive Director Patience Malaba. “These challenges are not confined to subsidized housing providers; they affect the entire housing ecosystem. Without bold actions to stabilize and sustain the sector, the risk of further destabilization is high, and tenants will ultimately bear the brunt of this collapse. Malaba continues, “The policy changes we propose aim to strike a careful balance between supporting providers’ ability to sustain housing operations while protecting renters and addressing systemic inequities. We will alongside reform be advocating for targeted rental assistance, reforming legislation to improve housing stability, and ensuring practical solutions that serve the entire housing ecosystem.” Housing advocates, who did not wish to go on the record at this time, warn not to be suckered by the “kinder face” of nonprofit landlords in HDC — they are aligned with for-profit landlords to make it easier to make people homeless. The Seattle City Council, which lurched rightward after the 2023 election, first hinted at repealing tenants' rights this summer when Community Roots Housing and Southeast Effective Development (SEED) gave a presentation about the woes of affordable housing developers. As I reported in July, the nonprofit developers did not explicitly call for rollbacks to any of the City’s modest protections. Instead, the nonprofits complained about the eviction backlog and asked for more resources for the tenant to pay their overdue rent or for courts to expedite the eviction of problematic tenants, potentially leading to homelessness. At the time, The Stranger clowned on Council President Sara Nelson for hearing what she wanted to hear from the presentation and from private landlords at public comment — repeal renters rights. And at the time, Nelson had been presumptuous based on the public conversations with HDC members. But now, according to the slide deck from last week, the nonprofit developers appear to have drunk the Kool-Aid, advocating with for-profit developers to implement policies that simply punish tenants without actually unclogging the eviction backlog. Even if you accept the premise that the government should make it easier for landlords to make people homeless, these reforms do not achieve that end. HDC wants the moratoriums to only cover evictions for non-payment for tenants who can prove they lost their income. “Rather than blanket moratoria,” HDC wrote, “the city should invest in a robust rental assistance program for tenants without income, experiencing financial hardship, or are cost burdened.” As I previously reported, the winter and school year evictions do not bottleneck the eviction process. The Housing Justice Project (HJP), which represents low-income tenants in court as part of the right-to-counsel law, does not use these defenses very often, rather finding errors in landlord paperwork. Skill issue. HDC’s proposal to price late fees at 3% of rent with a cap at $50 might put a few extra dollars in a landlord’s wallet, but renters overwhelmingly pay their rent in full and on time anyway. HDC claimed in their slide deck that “reasonable late fees foster timely payment habits and incentivize for tenants to stay current on rent.” Citations needed. HDC is also pushing to shorten the notice landlords must provide before raising rents. As it stands, landlords must give tenants six months’ notice before increasing the rent. HDC’s landlord wishlist would shorten that to 2 months or 4 months for increases above 8%. In the case of an 8% increase, HDC would allow tenants to break their lease with a 30 day notice. How generous! It is unclear how giving tenants less notice for price hikes would ease the eviction backlog unless the landlords also allowed greater flexibility for breaking leases. Sticking tenants with higher rent and less time to find a better paying job or rework their budget seems like a recipe for eviction. But what’s their answer for preventing evictions? A cash grab. HDC wrote, “The city should establish a rental assistance program for tenants without income. Funding could come from the Housing Levy homelessness prevention program which was allocated $30 million, targeted to the [Office of Housing] portfolio.” So, the City, already strapped for cash, should let landlords nickel and dime their tenants with late fees, increase rent with less notice, and, to add insult to injury, punch holes in the last line of defense tenants have between the warmth of their apartment and the cold, cold streets. Cool! According to the slide deck, HDC is expected to “move forward” legislation this month. That seems like too quick of a turn around — the year’s basically over, the council will likely focus on appointing a new member, and Nelson may seek to weaken the Ethics Code first, which could hamper the landed council members' ability to vote against the interest of renters. Council Member Cathy Moore, the Chair of the Homelessness and Human Services Committee, says she plans to meet with HDC to hear more about these proposals and will have more to share after that meeting. For now, her offices says, ""she believes changes are needed in order to ensure housing providers, across the spectrum, are able to continue to offer safe housing."" Harrell's office says he is ""interested in working with affordable housing providers on commonsense solutions to ensure their long-term stability and the health and safety of their residents.""",,"['mayor', 'city council', 'election', 'harrell', 'bruce harrell', 'nelson', 'sara nelson', 'foster', 'budget', 'housing', 'homeless', 'homelessness', 'policy', 'development', 'legislation']",35.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.339924,6253

At this point, progressives would endorse a cinder block over Nelson if it had a pulse and a fixed Seattle address. Fortunately, we don’t have to. Because we have Dionne Foster, an excellent candidate for this office. Rejoice! Foster, a former policy advisor for the city and the former executive director of the nonprofit Washington Progress Alliance, is a knowledgeable, likable, competent wonk. She wants to lead the way on economic justice. Stop this city’s affordability crisis and addiction to sweeps from displacing people. She’ll fight conservatives on this council willing to divert JumpStart funds from affordable housing. Unlike Nelson, Foster knows Seattle must go harder for housing density than the legal minimum set by the state and that it’s unrealistic for a real city expecting major growth in the next two decades to click its ruby red heels, ignore its housing needs, and remain an overgrown, dysfunctional suburb forever. Foster also wants to embrace affordability and outrun Washington’s regressive tax code with progressive revenue. She wants a municipal capital gains tax, a vacancy tax, and working with the state on a mansion tax. She has the right plans and can articulate exactly how she’d implement them, a rare quality on our curb-busting city council. She’s granular, but not myopic. And we believe her because she already did this work at the state level to pass the limited capital gains tax Foster has earned a heap of endorsements from politicians like Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, State Rep. Shaun Scott (D-43), and Scott’s dearly departed predecessor, Frank Chopp, because she is the best, quickest-witted candidate to walk through our door this election cycle. With two other seats up for reelection, that’s a chance she won’t be a progressive island on council. Nelson, on the other hand, is a fundamentally un-democratic chaos agent and a disastrous leader whose sole purpose has been to accumulate political power. Her Council’s “accomplishments” have been wildly unpopular: Approving a police contract with big raises and no accountability? Putting blast balls back in the hands of untrustworthy cops, and ensuring they can surveil us? Establishing “stay out” zones for drug users and sex workers that stigmatize people and don’t work? Attempting to weaken our ethics code and repeal protections for gig workers? We’re embarrassed. Seattle is immobilized in Nelson’s… full Nelson, controlled by business interests who shelled out hundreds of thousands of dollars for her meandering status quo that squeezes the renters, the poor, the homeless, and the disadvantaged on the margins. A skilled politician at least pretends to listen. Nelson is either incapable or indifferent. She shuts down anyone who is too loud and cumbersome for her taste. Her hostility for representative government and working people is boundless. But in her hallowed chambers at least we’ll have decorum, won’t we? Her contempt for the public seemed like the only reason competitor Connor Nash, a former state and federal employee, joined this race. Mia Jacobsen, on the other hand, is running a protest campaign to overhaul the system that puts people like Nelson in the driver’s seat. Nash was angry, shooed away too many times. But Nelson isn’t just the rock and the hard place. She’s a liability. A threat to reforms from a more progressive council, a roadblock to desperately needed progress on housing and homelessness, and the last person we want in city government when President Donald Trump comes to play. We’re tired of incompetence. We want someone with ideas, who loves this city and its people. A vote for Nelson is a vote for nihilism. A vote for Foster is a vote for intelligence, compassion, solutions, and a chance for a future.

The appointment process sucked; the unimaginative snoozers on the city council selected multiple-SECB-endorsement-loser Mark Solomon to take the seat. Luckily, Solomon isn’t running to keep the seat, so we have an open race on our hands! Which brings us to the pool of four viable D2 hopefuls: Union guy and SDCI inspector Jamie Fackler; restaurant organizer and activist Jeanie Chunn; assistant city attorney Eddie Lin; and mayoral transportation engagement manager Adonis Ducksworth. After a lively (read: tense, yell-y) discussion, the clear choice for D2 is Eddie Lin. As an assistant city attorney, Lin’s focus for the last several years has been working with the Office of Housing. When it comes to housing, and building more of it, Lin knows his stuff. In the midst of a never-ending housing crisis and a new Social Housing Developer on its way through the Seattle Process’s long birth canal, we need someone who can get shit done. Lin knows we need subsidized affordable units, social housing, limited equity co-ops, and everything else under the sun to get people four walls and a roof. Plus, whoever sits on council will implement Mayor Bruce Harrell’s Comprehensive Plan. Lin, a fiend for density and walkable neighborhoods, is a smart choice to kickstart the next 20 years of Seattle’s growth. One of the main hits against Lin, as Fackler repeatedly brought up, was that he didn’t go all out championing Proposition 1A, the voter measure that set up a funding mechanism for the Social Housing Developer. Lin didn't vote for it because, as a housing wonk, he was concerned that it was vulnerable to being undermined by a more conservative, Chamber-backed City Council. However, he says he’s come around and is ready to champion it. He’s also a total slut (sorry, Eddie) for progressive revenue. He’s DFAIT (Down For An Income Tax), a vacancy tax, and a city-level capital gains tax. We liked Chunn’s idea for a commercial vacancy tax, but felt she was still a little too green to hack it in City Hall. We hope to see her again. The other knock against Lin is, like all other candidates except Chunn, he wants more cops. Lin’s desire for increased police presence does go hand-in-hand with hiring a more diverse police force and expanding police alternatives. Plus, Lin’s experience with police brutality made him wary of cops. In his 20s, a Minneapolis police officer cuffed him, put his hands on his throat, and made racist comments—confusing Lin, who is Asian, for a Native American. The rattling experience forever changed Lin’s view of policing. We felt Fackler, while progressive and knowledgeable about the same issues, was too soft on the cops, especially their union. We’re certain Ducksworth will win the Seattle Times endorsement. He’s suave, charming, and doesn’t answer a single question. He’s also fucking cool. Sadly, underneath his skater chic, Ducksworth is nothing but a visionless moderate (read: Bruce Harrell). We already doubted he’d be our guy from the start, and he did us a solid by confirming that with a shitty, uninformed comment blaming drug users for their own predicament. “I did the ride along last week, and these guys asked at least 50 people, are they ready to go to treatment? We got one. We got one. So this comes down to the person on the street, too. Who wants to get off the street,” Ducksworth said. “That’s because some of the treatment options are not—,” Lin said. “They’re not asking about the treatment options,” Ducksworth interrupted. “They’re getting high.” Ducksworth’s mask came off. We did not like it under there. So, Lin is our guy. He’s the whole package. He’s a cat guy and a dog guy. He’s a public schools champion. This is why we willfully turned a blind eye to the fact that he could only name two examples when asked what his four favorite films were and one of them was White Lotus Season 1, famously not a movie. If he’s even seen a movie, he wasn’t paying attention. There weren’t enough housing solutions for his taste. Vote Lin. Editors Note: This endorsement originally appeared in The Stranger's July 2025 issue. In that version, we said Lin voted to support Prop 1A. After publication, his campaign clarified that he voted for 1B in February, but supports the social housing model now. We regret the error. Also, Jamie Fackler's last name is ""Fackler"" not ""Frackler"" (as it appeared in one instance in print). We regret the ""r.""

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/05/23/80070048/weve-got-a-mayors-race,The Stranger (Web),We’ve Got a Mayor’s Race! Just Can't Get Enough?,"A new poll by the Northwest Progressive Institute (NPI) tells us what we were all hoping to hear: We have a real mayor’s race this year. NPI, our local public opinion expert, ran a poll simulating a general election throw down between the two candidates who have raised the most in their campaigns so far: Transit Riders Union General Secretary Katie Wilson (at $256,318) and Mayor Bruce Harrell (at $390,585). The top line is: in a poll of 522 likely voters, Wilson got 36 percent of the vote, Harrell got 33, and 30 percent remained undecided. I know it looks like Wilson has a solid lead, but technically, the margin of error is 4 percent, so it’s a statistical tie. But it’s a tie! With two months left in the primary, Wilson is starting to give Harrell a run for his ($390k of) money. The survey was done in two parts. First, they asked respondents to choose between Wilson and Harrell, and more than half of them (56 percent) said they weren’t sure. Harrell had the benefit of name recognition, with 25 percent, and Wilson got 18. But then NPI gave the undecided respondents another shot, providing excerpts of the candidates’ positions, and links to their campaign websites. After reviewing them, the tables turned. Among the undecideds, 34 percent said they’d vote for Wilson, 15 for Harrell, and 51 percent remained unsure. When combined, we get 36 percent for Wilson, and 33 for Harrell. Harrell was clearly more recognizable to likely voters. But NPI’s polling also asked about his job performance, and Seattle just isn’t that into Harrell at this point. Only 37 percent of the city approves of his work, and 45 percent disapproves. When respondents were asked why they said they’d vote for Wilson, 10 of them simply said, “She’s not Bruce” or “She’s not Harrell.” And Seattle has a unique relationship with incumbents. Anywhere else, being an incumbent gives you a substantial leg up. But Seattle tends to speed date our mayors. In the last 25 years, we’ve only given one mayor a second term—Greg Nickels, who only got it because he didn’t have a good challenger. This poll is very early, and the number of undecideds shows that both candidates have a lot of work to do, and it could still be anyone’s race. “This race looks like it could go in multiple directions right now and could be one of the most exciting of this local election cycle,"" said NPI founder and executive director Andrew Villeneuve in a statement. The filing deadline was only two weeks ago, and while there’s still a lot of campaigning ahead of us, the race is starting to take shape. In a city without political parties, the closest thing we have is two major donor classes: labor and business. And so far, Harrell is sweeping the field. This week, the MLK Labor council, our county’s union of unions, endorsed Harrell. So has the CEO of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, Governor Bob Ferguson, AG Nick Brown, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, among many others. But Wilson has momentum—and not just based on this poll. She qualified for the democracy voucher program in just five days, and is collecting endorsements from groups like the King County Democrats, the Transit Riders Union (duh), and progressives like former City Councilmember Tammy Morales.",,"['mayor', 'councilmember', 'election', 'harrell', 'bruce harrell', 'wilson', 'katie wilson', 'morales', 'tammy morales', 'labor', 'union', 'mayor (title)']",32.5,2025-08-05T19:10:44.339924,3236
https://www.thestranger.com/stranger-election-control-board/2025/07/03/80127888/vote-for-erika-evans-for-city-attorney,The Stranger (Web),Vote for Erika Evans for City Attorney Just Can't Get Enough?,"In case you’ve been living under a rock for the last three-and-a-half years, let us brief you on our current City Attorney: the regrettable Republican Ann Davison. The City Attorney has two jobs: one criminal (prosecuting all of the city’s misdemeanor cases, like DUIs and domestic violence charges) and one civil (acting as the city’s attorney, either suing people or other governments and also defending Seattle in court when, for instance, the Seattle Chamber of Commerce sues the city to kill the JumpStart tax). From a criminal perspective, Davison’s whole thing is being “tough on crime,” which famously does nothing to make our city safer or to get people on the streets the help they need. She instituted policies like Close-in-Time filing. Implemented in 2022, it’s meant to reduce the criminal case backlog, but really just places the backlog in a different pile. It hasn’t worked. Her “High Utilizer Initiative” to target frequent offenders, surprise, also doesn’t solve any problems and worsens recidivism. Plus, Davison killed “community court,” an alternative system that offers people charged with misdemeanors non-punitive options to resolve their cases. Meanwhile, Davison is unforgivably behind on filing DUI cases—one of the two serious misdemeanors the office can prosecute. Domestic violence cases are lagging. Back in 2021, before Davison, it took 26 days to file a DV case. Last year, on average, it took twice as long. Davison is a tumor on the city and we don’t expect her to be willing to stand up to Trump. She converted to the Republican party during DJT’s first term, when anyone with an ounce of sense jumped ship. When King County, San Francisco, Santa Clara County, Portland, and New Haven signed onto a lawsuit against the Department of Homeland Security for their attacks on “sanctuary jurisdictions,” Davison dragged her feet, only joining the lawsuit months later. Meanwhile, while Boston and 43 other cities (including our less progressive neighbors, Spokane and Olympia) fought cuts to federal research funding, Davison stayed out of it. This person cannot protect us from the next three-and-a-half years (or more) of authoritarian encroachment. So, she sucks. We can’t let her win again. And she could. With three progressive challengers splitting the left vote, Davison will almost certainly skate through the primary, liberal Seattle bubble be damned. The people who didn’t march in the No Kings rally get ballots, too! Of this bunch, we believe Erika Evans, a former assistant US Attorney, is our choice to best Ann, make the City Attorney’s office effective and fair, and protect Seattle from the Trump administration. Evans has prosecuted hate crimes, she’s gone after drug traffickers, she’s slapped the wrists of business owners dipping into their employees’ wages, and she was involved in a case prosecuting January 6ers from Puyallup. Her résumé is impressive. Her platform (speed up DUI and DV case filings, bring back community court, prosecute wage theft, improve the police union contract to allow for more policing alternatives) mirrors the platforms of her opponents. But they don’t have her grit. In our meeting, Evans leapt for her opponents’ throats. She presented exhibits for every argument, and demonstrated a deep understanding of the power, and limitations, of the City Attorney’s Office. She spoke thoughtfully about the importance of working closely with Washington Attorney General Nick Brown against the constitutionally intolerant Trump administration, and made a commitment to not prosecute “peaceful” protesters (though she wouldn’t define a “peaceful protester” for us, which is peak prosecutor brain). We also love a prop comedian: she brought Jarritos and African Black soap to symbolize SOAP/SODA laws, a Raggedy Ann doll to represent Davison, a printout of photos of the white men who have held this office for the 150 years before Ann got the job, a binder of her and her opponents case files. Sure, she gave Model-UN vibes, and if being corny were illegal this woman would be in jail. But it isn’t. And what we care about is Evans’s ability and will to protect us when Trump goes after this city. We know, we know. A history as a prosecutor brings with it a track record of upholding a system built for oppression. But our federal government is actively antagonistic to cities like ours, and a prosecutor knows how the federal government works. Evans knows what levers to pull. And local progressives such as City Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck and State Rep. Shaun Scott believe she’s the right choice despite all the prosecutorial baggage. But we don’t discount her mistakes and our misgivings. Evans voted for Bruce Harrell last election (“But I voted for Nikkita Oliver twice when they ran,” Evans said). She donated $100 to Harrell’s campaign before Katie Wilson got into the race, but wouldn’t say whom she was voting for in this election, and hedged by saying she couldn’t talk shit when the winner could be her client. Public defenders are worried about what her real intentions are and how she’ll act when she’s in the seat of power. We understand where they’re coming from. But we’re inviting her to prove them wrong. This wasn’t an easy decision. Any of Davison’s challengers would be wildly better for Seattle. We wish we could have endorsed Nathan Rouse, the public defender running for the seat, because he knows the system doesn’t work for everyday people and wants to change it. He’s tougher on the Seattle Police Officers Guild than any other candidates. But he didn’t convince us he could put his ideas into action or win. Please run again next time, Nathan. We want to see you in our swivel chairs again, with more experience under your belt. Thanks for the Pop-Tarts. And Rory O’Sullivan could do a perfectly fine job in the role. But he lacks trial experience. And most importantly, we aren’t confident he could beat Davison. Evans will hit the ground running in a way we need. Here’s to knocking Davison into the stratosphere.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/06/27/80120394/progressive-revenue-is-not-dead-in-seattle,The Stranger (Web),Progressive Revenue Is Not Dead in Seattle Just Can't Get Enough?,"Seattle electeds have finally realized that they can’t simply rely on the Jumpstart Tax, a progressive (but fluctuating) payroll tax, to backfill budget shortfalls in perpetuity, and they are pursuing new progressive revenue options. I know, I know, this city council and this mayor finding new revenue methods? Our financial outlook is that bad. The Seattle Shield Initiative united an odd duo, Council Member Alexis Mercedes Rinck and Mayor Bruce Harrell. Together, they proposed the initiative to help alleviate the financial stress that a $251 million deficit across all fund balances—and Trump in the White House—will put on the city. The initiative will temporarily raise business and occupation (B&O) taxes to fund programs threatened by the Donald Trump administration, such as investments in housing vouchers, shelters, food and nutrition access, resources for survivors of gender-based violence, and affordable housing. But it gets better. The initiative doesn’t raise the B&O tax for all businesses, only some. Under the initiative, to help bolster struggling mom and pop shops, many small businesses will actually stop paying B&O tax. Sounds pretty good, right? Not if you’re part of a big business organization. The Downtown Seattle Association (DSA, but not the cool one) and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce have already poo-poo’d the proposed initiative. Jon Scholes, president and CEO of the DSA (derogatory) and frequent bad-opinion columnist at the Seattle Times, said in a statement that the Trump tariffs are already bad for business and city leaders are about to “make things worse on local companies” with this new tax. “This proposal is a tax on downtown Seattle’s revitalization and a self-inflicted wound to the progress we’ve been making to attract more businesses downtown and strengthen the city’s tax base. It will make it harder to fill empty tall office buildings and storefronts with companies, which will threaten the commercial tax base and shift more of the tax burden to residents,” Scholes wrote. The Seattle Shield Initiative will raise the B&O tax threshold exemption from $100,000 to $2,000,000 in gross revenue, which means 76 percent of small businesses won’t pay any B&O tax at all. Meanwhile, only businesses earning more than $2 million in revenue will have to pay a higher tax than they did before. According to a press release from the city, “approximately 90% of businesses would owe less than they do today.” Of course, that means those high-earners would shoulder the B&O tax. This is unfair, according to Scholes. “City leaders should heed the lessons from the past and reject boneheaded ideas solely concocted in the name of fighting President Trump,” Scholes wrote. “This rushed tax proposal is bad fiscal policy that will set Seattle back and raise costs for residents.” He had some big, weird feelings (“It’s the fiscal policy version of Seattle’s defund the police movement and if passed will ultimately result in Seattle defunding its tax base,” he wrote on LinkedIn. “This idea should be thrown in the trash bin next to the remnants of defund the police, CHOP/CHAZ, legalizing drugs, etc”) and I’m sure we’ll hear more from him in a forthcoming Seattle Times editorial. But, I must say, this is pretty funny outrage coming from the organization that just pushed policy through the Seattle City Council to put eyesore digital advertising kiosks on Seattle streets. The money earned from those kiosks will go right back into DSA coffers. Maybe they can use some of that money to help their struggling big businesses pay the B&O tax increase. In response to these comments, at a press conference, Harrell said, “We think it’s good policy, and we would disagree [with the DSA].” Remember, this is from longtime DSA (again, not the socialist one) ally Harrell. Do we… gotta hand it to him? “We are not trying to run business out of Seattle, we are open for business,” Harrell, newly anointed fan of progressive revenue (or just a man worried about being another one-term mayor), continued. “So as we look at dealing with a $250 million deficit… The fact is that the state legislature only gives us so many tools, and this is a tool we think along the lines of progressive revenue that is a smart policy to adopt...We will do everything possible to continue to have a healthy business environment, but we stand behind this policy.” In a statement to The Stranger, Mercedes Rinck said, ""It’s true. This proposal progressively shifts B&O tax burden to the largest businesses in Seattle. The top 10 percent will pay more, and the bottom and middle will pay less. I think we can all see that as a worthwhile investment in the local community, workforce, and economy. What will actually set Seattle back is doing nothing while thousands in our community are on the brink of food insecurity and homelessness due to draconian federal cuts."" Wealthy business owner gripes aside, this initiative is a boon for small businesses, according to Jeanie Chunn, community activist, longtime small business advocate, and current candidate for City Council District 2. Chunn, who helped engage small business owners on this initiative for Rinck's office, described how paying fewer B&O taxes will make a huge difference. Especially for businesses operating on the margins like restaurants, having extra funds could pay for much-needed new equipment, new benefits for employees, or repairs. The initiative will provide “much welcomed relief,” she wrote in an email. According to Chunn, most restaurants fall under the $2 million revenue threshold. Even for those who rake in over $2 million annually, they’ll still pay less in local B&O taxes than they do currently because “it's only on sales over $2M.” The Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce jumped to its usual excuses for the reasons we can’t raise taxes: It has some “interesting ideas,” but it’s “rushed,” and companies just can’t afford it right now. “I think the Chamber of Commerce's outrage over this initiative shows that they have and will always represent the interests of large corporations and not locally-owned businesses, small business owners, or the workers of Seattle,” Chunn wrote. ""If the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce only wants to advocate for the preferences of their Emerald and Platinum members, that is their prerogative,"" Mercedes Rinck told The Stranger. ""Local government has responsibility to step up in this moment, and our proposal gives Seattle residents that choice."" However, the Seattle Shield Initiative is not law yet. Rinck will need to curry favor with the other members of the council. They will have to vote on the initiative by Aug. 5. If it's approved, we the people will get to have our say in the November election.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/08/05/80181915/seattle-city-council-passed-the-shield-tax,The Stranger (Web),Seattle City Council Passed the Shield Tax Just Can't Get Enough?,"The Seattle City Council voted unanimously Monday to put progressive revenue on the ballot in the general election this November. Don’t get too excited—we didn’t jump into some sort of alternate universe where we have a progressive city council and mayor (though, that could happen in this reality depending on if you vote how we tell you today). Our electeds just finally decided to do something about the hundreds of millions of dollar city budget deficit we’re facing. Enter: The Shield Tax Initiative. Originally proposed by Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck and an election-wary Mayor Bruce Harrell, the legislation was billed as a defense against federal government-induced cutbacks in key service areas. These included housing vouchers, shelters, food access, resources for survivors of gender-based violence, and affordable housing. To do that, Rinck and Harrell proposed raising the Business & Occupation tax for some big businesses while lowering it for 90 percent of Seattle’s businesses—a win for mom and pop shops and a thorn in Amazon’s side. In original forecasts, staffers in the Office of Economic and Revenue Forecasts estimated the new B&O tax legislation would garner an extra $90 million for those services. However, after the council tacked on more than a dozen amendments such as one exempting Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center and Seattle Children’s Hospital from the tax, the new projections fell to around $80 million. The Shield Tax was pitched to the public as a way to protect Seattle from a belligerent federal government, but the reality is we’ve desperately needed more progressive revenue in this city years before the financial threat of President Donald Trump. On Monday, budget staff estimated that the council is looking down the barrel of an estimated $150 million deficit (or higher, if the economy tanks). That number is an improvement over the $240 million hole in a previous budget forecast, but not something we can just wish away with pro-business thoughts and prayers. Reworking the B&O tax will help close that gap. Whatever we can do to avoid austerity—the cutting back of necessary programs to save money—is good. At last week’s council meeting, the vast majority of public commenters spoke in favor of the bill. They represented food access organizations worried about evaporating federal funding, organizations that provide services for victims of gender-based violence, and homelessness service providers. “We’re the backup when the federal government fails us,” said a commenter who works in senior meal programming. “Please don’t forget about us,” said several other commenters. Navigating budget deficits is difficult for any city, but it’s especially hard for one in Washington, a state with one of the most regressive tax systems in the country. We want to tax the rich (income tax), but we can’t, so we tax rich businesses, angering wealthier businesses and their mouthpiece, the Seattle Chamber of Commerce. “The city’s proposal gives needed relief to small businesses, something that we—and voters—strongly support, but we are disappointed that city leaders have also chosen to raise the B&O for many other hometown companies, making Seattle’s economic environment more volatile and uncertain,” Rachel Smith, president and CEO of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce said in a press release. “This policy choice simply misses the mark.” In public comment last week, the Downtown Seattle Association said that this bill would discourage business development when we should be focusing on filling vacant buildings downtown. The new rules for the B&O tax limit what businesses have to pay. Now, businesses with gross revenue under $2 million will be exempt. According to the City, more than three quarters of current B&O taxpayers would no longer pay the tax, and about 90 percent of Seattle businesses would owe less than they do today. “This is a significant win for Seattle’s small businesses and our broader community,” Harrell said in a statement. “By reducing taxes for 90 percent of businesses, we are helping local entrepreneurs thrive and compete while ensuring they can continue to contribute to the fabric of our neighborhoods.” The remaining 10 percent of businesses would absorb the B&O burden, and raise the additional $81 million. However, the wider economic landscape remains unpredictable. The impacts of Donald Trump’s tariffs haven’t been fully felt. We’re still teetering on the edge of a recession and last month’s job report—which also revealed the gloomy reality of May and June’s jobs reports—was so dismal Trump fired the person who reported the facts. If this swirling cloud of economic disaster ever makes landfall, it could prove tough on a now-smaller-than-ever pool of businesses paying more into the B&O tax that’s providing the scaffolding to keep the city aloft, according to the council’s central staff’s financial report. It’s a risk the city will have to take if we want to keep essential services and programs intact while the federal government fucks around with everyone’s livelihoods. The voters will ultimately decide this November. So, prepare yourself for the onslaught of business association-backed attack ads in the coming months and ready your ballot-bubbling pens.",,"['mayor', 'city council', 'councilmember', 'election', 'harrell', 'bruce harrell', 'budget', 'housing', 'homelessness', 'taxes', 'policy', 'development', 'legislation', 'city council (title)']",30.5,2025-08-05T19:10:44.344963,5277

Turns out Donald Trump was personally told by Attorney General Pam Bondi back in May that his name pops up multiple times in the Epstein files—the very same files the feds promised to release before pulling a hard U-turn. According to The Wall Street Journal, both Bondi and FBI-director-loyalist Kash Patel warned Trump, brushing off the mentions as “unverified hearsay” about his old Epstein hangouts. And Trump? He responded the way any totally innocent person would: by hanging up on CNN. With even some House Republicans now backing Dems to get those files out in the open and Ghislaine Maxwell freshly subpoenaed, the Epstein vortex is sucking DC back into its sleaze orbit.

Meanwhile, trucks packed with food, clean water, and medicine sit idle just outside Gaza—trapped by a siege designed not to fail, but to punish. “Each morning, the same question echoes across Gaza: will I eat today?” one agency rep said. The answer, too often, is no. This isn’t just a famine. It’s a war crime, and every day the world delays, more lives are lost to the politics of cruelty. Hellfire Roast: Turns out Starbucks isn’t just serving up venti-sized lattes—it’s pouring out infernal levels of executive greed. Per the AFL-CIO’s new Executive Paywatch report, CEO Brian Niccol made 6,666 times more than the company’s typical worker last year. That’s right: six-six-six-six—a number so cursed it practically demands a goat sacrifice. While Niccol sipped nearly $98 million in compensation, the average barista scraped by on less than $15K. Starbucks claims this is because many workers are part-time, but that hasn’t stopped the company from dropping millions on union-busting lawyers and listening sessions instead of just, you know, paying people more. Workers have been striking, organizing, and dragging the company into court for years—meanwhile, Niccol’s getting a fat Trump-era tax cut on top of his stock-heavy bonus package. That mocha latte might taste a little more bitter now. The Government Just Ghosted Your Debt Relief: So, the Department of Education just hit pause on student loan forgiveness for folks in Income-Based Repayment plans. Which means if you’ve been grinding for years thinking you were finally done, the government’s like, “Actually, we need to recalculate your trauma first.” Interest kicks back in August 1, the tax break on forgiven debt expires in January, and a Trump administration, already hostile to student debt relief, most likely slow-walking the loan forgiveness process like it's a hostage negotiation. God forbid working people catch a break without crawling through a decade of red tape and moral judgment. Now, let us get into the tragicomedy that is our local news… Fergie Has Some ‘Splaining to Do: While Gov. Ferguson was thwarting taxes on billionaires last budget session, he somehow missed the stack of misconduct allegations piling up against his right-hand man, Mike Webb. Axios reports that although Webb resigned this year after multiple women accused him of creating a hostile work environment, red flags on the guy go back to 2013, with state auditors raising alarms as far back as 2019 with Ferguson’s office. The paraphrased response from Ferguson’s crew at the time? No formal HR complaint, so we’re good. Political code for “If you didn’t notarize your trauma, it doesn’t count.” And the kicker? Webb’s still tagging along and flying shotgun on campaign trips with Ferguson’s team as recently as last month. Apparently, in state politics, being a powerful creep doesn’t get you canceled. It gets you extra leg room. No Last Words, Just Lasting Rage: At his sentencing for the brutal murders of four University of Idaho students, Bryan Kohberger sat stone-faced and silent—offering zero explanation, zero remorse, and zero closure to the families he devastated. Prosecutors didn’t bother pushing for a plea deal that would force him to speak, because let’s be real: no one needed more self-serving nonsense from a guy who thinks silence makes him mysterious instead of monstrous. The Goncalves family, especially Kaylee’s sister Alivea, didn’t hold back—calling him “pathetic” and making it crystal clear he only succeeded because he attacked in the dark, like a coward. No motive, no mercy, no justice—just a courtroom full of grief staring down a man who will never give them what they actually deserve. Court Upholds Birthright Citizenship, for Now: A federal appeals court has ruled Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship unconstitutional, echoing a previous decision from a New Hampshire district court. Essentially, Terror 47 tried to rewrite the Constitution with magic marker, and the courts just reminded him that reality still exists. The ruling simply states what every exhausted civics teacher in America has been screaming into the void: you can’t undo the 14th Amendment just because it ruins your fascist fantasy. Washington was one of the states to bring the case against the administration. Fire in the Central District: A fire tore through Seattle’s Chinatown International Central District early Thursday, starting in a vacant home under construction and spreading to several neighboring homes, displacing multiple families. Thankfully, no residents were seriously hurt, although one firefighter was treated for minor injuries. The city is currently investigating the cause of the fire. Can’t Win in Court? Block the Judge: Municipal Court Judge Damon Shadid just dragged City Attorney Ann Davison’s office in open court for what looks like a power-hungry, politically motivated stunt—blocking Judge Pooja Vaddadi from hearing DUI and domestic violence cases based on what Vaddadi says are straight-up lies. Davison’s move, which sidelined a newly elected judge and basically turned a voter mandate into a desk job, has now triggered a formal bar complaint and serious questions about ethics, transparency, and who actually gets to wield power in Seattle’s justice system. And now, as Davison runs for reelection with MAGA baggage and a suddenly fat campaign account, she’s facing three challengers who seem more interested in actual justice than playing courtroom politics. Do Not Sign This Shit! In a raging case of voter suppression FOMO, Washington state conservatives are pushing a ballot initiative to literally gatekeep democracy. It's the bureaucratic equivalent of “Show us your papers, comrade,” as if the right to vote should come with a TSA checkpoint and a scavenger hunt for your birth certificate. No more checking a box. It would now be, prove you’re American enough, or get the hell out of the ballot line. Let’s just be real: the GOP doesn’t fear non-citizens voting. They fear citizens voting against them. If they can’t win your vote, they’ll sure as hell try to make it as hard as possible to vote in the first place. Waterfront Park Officially Opens: Our Emerald City officially unveiled its latest glow-up moment with the opening of the new Waterfront Park. Yes, 50,000 square feet of vibes where a collapsing highway used to loom like a concrete guillotine. After 15 years, we get a jellyfish-shaped playground, a fountain plaza, and 270 free events later this Summer. Essentially, it’s the city saying, “Sorry about the viaduct drama, here’s some yoga and a couple of food pop-ups.” Seattle Loves Renters So Much It Won’t Even Let Them Meet: For 18 months, Cathy Moore basically ghosted the Seattle Renters’ Commission. There were no hearings, no appointments, nothing, while she pushed bills that would’ve made it way easier to evict people. Flash forward: she resigns, and just when it looks like the commission might finally get seated, Councilmembers Rob Saka and Sara Nelson pull a classic “Sorry, can’t come, super busy avoiding the duties we were elected to fulfill” move and tank the meeting by skipping it. Meanwhile, renters—many of them volunteers who took time off work—showed up ready to serve their community, only to get hit with silence, shade, and a 404 error from Saka’s office. You can’t make this up. Donnie Chin Honored: Ten years after Donnie Chin was shot and killed while responding to a 911 call, the Chinatown-International District showed up, not just to mourn, but to remember a man who basically did the city’s job for it. Donnie wasn’t just a first responder; he was the first responder, often beating cops and medics to the scene because the system didn’t care enough to show up for his community. And here’s the part that still stings: a decade later, his murder is still unsolved. Your Obligatory Seahawks 411: For the 5 percent of you who actually care and the 15 percent who just want to survive small talk with your partner’s meathhead sibling, here’s your Seahawks update. They just kicked off training camp for their 50th season with a new offensive coordinator, a quarterback best known for seeing “ghosts” mid-game, and the kind of blind optimism usually reserved for football fans and people joining multi-level marketing schemes. Last year, they went 10-7 and still missed the playoffs. But hey, if the defense stays mean, the rookies stay healthy, and the offense stops self-sabotaging, they might just luck their way into the postseason. Death gives Hogan the big boot: I’m a firm believer that you shouldn’t valorize people, simply because their heart stops beating. So, I won’t pretend Hulk Hogan was anything but what he was. He died at 71 from cardiac arrest in Florida, leaving behind a legacy as bloated and performative as pro wrestling itself. Yes, he helped turn wrestling into a pop culture juggernaut, but he also brought us sex tapes, racist rants, and more tall tales than a televangelist on mushrooms—Elvis was a Hulkamaniac? Really? Even in death, Hogan is less a man than a cautionary tale—part myth, part lawsuit, and all-American spectacle, brother. I’ll Leave You With this: someone just randomly texted me that it’s Jennifer Lopez’s birthday. I’m not a fan, so I’m not sure why I needed that information, but apparently she’s completed her 56th lap around the sun.

That was because we knew that if she was elected, she (and at the time, Tammy Morales before she was bullied out of City Hall) would be a progressive in a sea of conservatism. As we hoped, she pushed back: She voted against giving SPD more access to “less lethal” weapons, and when her colleagues approved additional surveillance from law enforcement, she opposed it. But more important than what she didn’t do is what she did. Despite being on council with people allergic to helping the city, Rinck found other ways to show up. She supported counterprotesters at a Christian Supremacist group in Cal Anderson, and was instrumental in convincing the city to deescalate the situation. She spoke out at the committee hearing when Council Member Cathy Moore tried to defang our city’s ethics code, even though she wasn’t on that committee (and even though Council President Sara Nelson tried desperately to shut her up). Rinck knows that being on city council gives her a voice, and she’s shown us over and over again that she’s willing to use it for ordinary people. She’s also clearly the voice we need to start fixing our ass-backward revenue streams in Seattle. Just weeks after our endorsement interview, she presented a collaborative effort with the mayor to reform our tax code to reduce the taxes that small businesses are paying, shift the burden to big business, and raise an extra $90 million in the process. Now that’s what we call progressive revenue! Rinck doesn’t have much competition in this race. Her standout opponent is Rachael Savage, who quite frankly fascinates us, even if we had to sage the office after she left. A Republican with chunky jewelry and overlined lipstick who started the election season running for mayor, Savage switched to a City Council race just before the filing deadline. She owns a new-age shop on Capitol Hill, runs a meditation program, and believes that her experience getting sober justifies her argument that people who are mentally ill or dealing with “late-stage” addiction should be shipped to facilities for Shiny Happy People outside of the city. Oh, and she told us words are never violent and hate speech doesn’t exist. This election has the chance to reshape our city council into a functioning governing body (would we even recognize it?) and we want to see what Rinck can do when she’s not swimming upstream.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/07/29/80170952/city-council-ghosted-the-renters-commission-last-week-will-they-show-up-today,The Stranger (Web),City Council Ghosted the Renters Commission Last Week. Will They Show Up Today? Just Can't Get Enough?,"However devout your atheism, for the sake of Seattle renters and what’s left of Mark Solomon’s hairline, pray that his city council colleagues actually do on Tuesday what they couldn’t manage at last week’s Housing and Human Services Committee (HHS) meeting: Show the hell up. Last Wednesday, after an 18-month delay, members of the Seattle Renters Commission were scheduled to finally be appointed—and in some cases reappointed—to the city’s volunteer renters advisory board. Commissioners, supporters, and rental advocates filled council chambers anticipating an appointment vote, only for the process to collapse. Neither Council President Sara Nelson nor Councilmember Rob Saka attended, leaving the committee short of quorum. With former chair Cathy Moore having already resigned, the committee could afford to lose no more than two members. “Look, people are volunteering their time. They’re not getting paid for this. We owe it to them to listen and make it happen,” Solomon, the committee’s vice chair, told The Stranger. On paper, the Seattle Renters’ Commission exists to give renters a seat at the table of influence that too often forgets they’re there. It’s charged with advising the Mayor, City Council, and city departments on the policies that shape whether tenants merely scrape by, or live with a shred of stability in a city where north of $128,000 still has many hitting the Grocery Outlet every other week. Nelson had informed Solomon the day before she’d be absent, without offering a public explanation. Saka, citing personal reasons, notified Solomon less than 30 minutes before the 9:30 a.m. start time that he couldn’t attend. Solomon told The Stranger that he believed that the two had legitimate reasons for not showing up, but other council members weren’t as generous. “It’s hard for me to read this as anything other than intentional suppression of representation of renters who are at much higher risk of being displaced. The people in this city deserve people who will actually show up for them and do the work,” Alexis Mercedes Rinck, a member of Solomon’s committee and the only renter currently on the council, told The Stranger. Rinck wasn’t alone in her exasperation. Backlash was swift from renters’ rights and anti-displacement advocates, who saw the absences as yet another attempt to stall a process neglected for nearly a year and a half under Moore’s leadership. During that time, ten of the commission’s fifteen seats went unfilled and nominees received no hearings, even as Moore attempted to advance legislation to roll back tenant protections. “To fail to appoint commissioners in the last scheduled committee meeting before recess is to undermine not only that group’s ability to convene and meaningfully carry out its role: it is to contribute to the sense that ‘government’ has no interest in solving problems of the people, by the people, and for the people,” Alison Eisinger, Executive Director of the Seattle/King County Coalition on Homelessness, wrote in an email to Solomon, Saka, and Nelson after last week’s debacle. Commission confirmations are now scheduled to take place at Tuesday’s full council meeting, along with other business that was delayed due to the absences, including appointments to the Disability Commission. Eisinger had previously pressed Moore on the need to schedule confirmations, calling her refusal to do so a “counterproductive approach to engaging constituents in the work of understanding and addressing the issues and needs of more than 50% of Seattle residents who are renters.” Solomon, who represents South Seattle on the council, says that’s why Tuesday’s meeting is all the more urgent: “That gives us a way forward to seat these folks … we owe it to them to listen and make it happen.” In statements, both Nelson and Saka acknowledged the frustration caused by their absences. For Kate Rubin, a commissioner whose term expired in February and who is seeking reappointment on Tuesday, their excuses rang hollow. “I absolutely believe it was deliberate,” Rubin says. “The email from former Councilmember Moore at 2:30 in the morning confirms it.” The recently resigned Moore’s email directly urged Saka, Nelson, and Solomon to delay the vote, though she later told the Seattle Times that her email to Solomon bounced back. “Beyond that, there’s just been a dismissive attitude toward the Renters Commission since this new council took office,” Rubin says. For renters’ rights advocates, it’s difficult not to interpret last week’s absences, Moore’s witching-hour email lobbying, and her earlier pushes to rollback renter protections and to remake the Renters Commission to include landlords—a shift Rubin says would further muffle the voices of a rental population that now outnumbers homeowners—as anything but a ploy to run out the clock before Moore’s replacement, Debora Juarez, takes office risking further delays in seating the commission. While the Renters Commission is technically advisory, it does weigh in on appointments to Seattle’s Social Housing Authority—the public developer tasked with building, owning, and maintaining permanently affordable mixed-income housing. The council’s conservative bloc has historically resisted Social Housing, pushing an alternative tax measure last year in opposition to it. Rubin says that without the backlash, she doubts the council would have moved with such urgency, fast‑tracking the confirmation for Tuesday instead of letting it languish. Though she’s hopeful it will finally bring long-overdue confirmations, she’s clear that the work is barely beginning. Seattle’s average rent hit $2,110 last month—30 percent higher than the national average, leaving the city among the country’s priciest rental markets. “Fully fund tenant services,” Rubin says. “The people supporting renters are underpaid, overworked, and burning out. Engage renters more in decisions that affect them, not just during 9-to-5 public comment. And create real accountability for landlords. Right now, code enforcement is complaint-based, and landlords can get away with violations just by stopping when they’re caught. Renters deserve a system that actually protects them.” In short, even if all confirmations on the day go forward, it isn’t the finish line. It’s the bare minimum. And if the council can’t manage even that, what hope is there for a city where renters are already running out of money, patience, and most of all, time?",,"['mayor', 'city council', 'councilmember', 'juarez', 'debora juarez', 'nelson', 'sara nelson', 'housing', 'homelessness', 'legislation', 'city council (title)']",27.5,2025-08-05T19:10:44.308168,6455
https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/03/07/79956841/dionne-foster-is-not-sara-nelson-so-who-is-she,The Stranger (Web),"Dionne Foster Is Not Sara Nelson. So, Who Is She? Just Can't Get Enough?","On Monday, Dionne Foster announced her candidacy for Seattle’s citywide District 9 seat, challenging City Council President Sara Nelson. Foster is currently the executive director of the Washington Progress Alliance, an advocacy organization that helped push through the state’s new capital gains tax to fund education. While that’s a big, progressive win, it’s not her only policymaking experience. At one point in her long and varied career, she was a Senior Policy Advisor for the City of Seattle. Before making it to city hall, she worked her way through school in the restaurant industry, earned a Master’s of Social Work at the University of Washington, and did a bunch of nuts and bolts policy analysis for places like King County and Puget Sound Sage. She’s got a teenage son who does roller derby. In an interview, she listed her hobbies as doing standard PNW outdoorsy stuff (including Trailhead Direct) and taking him to roller derby. Cute! Given recent polling, plus decisive wins in recent elections for lefty progressive Alexis Mercedes Rinck and a proposal to fund social housing from the coffers of rich corporations, Foster stands a good chance of unseating Nelson. Besides the fact that the political pendulum is swinging back to the left (which is, depending on how hard you squint, where Foster sits), Nelson has not exactly made friends during her time in office. “I would vote for a rock if it ran against right-wing, drunkard millionaire Sara Nelson,” one Redditt user put it in response to Foster’s announcement. “Because even a rock would drag us down less than her.” Foster is not a rock, thankfully. She is a person with a pulse and has ideas about what to do with this beautiful, backward city of ours. So what are they and how do they differ from her opponent’s? Will they bring about the big, transformative changes needed to dig ourselves out of the housing and homelessness crisis we’re in? We used the word “specific” or some variation of it twelve times in our interview, but Foster artfully dodged any tangible policy commitments. When pressed for more details, she said, “I feel like as we continue through the campaign, I’d love to continue to share more specifics and say this exact thing or more details.” Similarly, in response to a list of yes/no lightning round questions sent post-interview (which included a bonus round asking for favorite local spots), she responded, “Really excited to get into these over the course of the campaign! Current food obsessions — Tailwind Cafe salted chocolate chip cookie & Ba Bar imperial rolls.” Sadly, we do not get any certainty on whether she agrees with the Mayor’s sweeps blitz or supports social housing. She’s right about the imperial rolls, at least, but we get the point: it’s just vibes for now. That said, her vibes on the issues of the moment — housing and homelessness — are generally good. On housing, she wants to “make sure that we have both abundant housing and affordable housing.” Again, no specifics, but she did say she thinks we can do more than is mandated by HB 1110, the state law that legalized fourplexes everywhere and six plexes on transit lines. “We should be doing more, and we should be making sure that Seattle is a place that leads on this,” she said. Foster has called out displacement as a major issue. She currently lives in South Seattle, which gives you something of a front row seat to it. What would she do to combat it? She cited down payment assistance and subsidized artist housing as keeping her and her co-parent, respectively, here in the city. Regarding housing, she said we need to “execute our plan well” when it comes to growth, and “think about ways to protect our neighborhood centers.” Sounds good! Foster is excited to roll out a comprehensive policy as she moves further into her campaign. “I think right now, really wanting to make sure that I'm introducing people to me, my values, and how I think about the issues that we're facing.” Okay, okay, we get it! But what about transportation? She lives a short walk away from a light rail station, and uses it when she doesn’t have to drive her kid to roller derby practice over in White Center. Thanks to that lateral commute, plus her co-parent’s old route to work, which involved the #50, Foster is acutely aware of the lack of east-west transit in the South End. And, again thanks to the #50, just how long it can take to get places on Seattle transit. Breaking with her no-specifics theme, she did call out some action items for pedestrian and bike safety: better lighting, more crosswalks, and traffic calming. She’s also got lived experience on this one, having been the victim of a very low-speed hit and run on Rainier Ave S. We don’t love that she had to live that experience, but we do love that she knows what it’s like for walkers out here. On cops, we have nothing extraordinary to report. We didn’t chat about it much, but like every politician in this city, she’s in favor of hiring more cops. She also has written the infamous “hire more women guards” meme into her platform. Oof. But she’s in favor of building out the CARE team, our alternative response program, and addressing “root causes” of crime. That’s about the best we’re gonna get from anyone these days. We also briefly touched on climate. She said she was, “really proud to get to be a part of the entire Defend Washington team last year, which included making sure that we could protect the state Climate Commitment Act and the resources that flow from the Climate Commitment Act.” Besides that, she shouted out transit-oriented development as a good strategy to reduce car trips and by extension lower emissions, but didn’t offer anything else in terms of specific policy proposals. Overall, Foster emphasized that she’s a person who focuses on results. As she told both Publicola and us, she wants to “get shit done.” In a city plagued by endless, intractable processes, that’s music to our ears. We also love that she’s someone who takes the train and has worked for an hourly wage sometime in the last ten years. Can’t say that about most of the current council. However, she also already displays a politician’s natural affinity for polite vagaries and plausible deniability. While people are very bummed about most of the shit the current council has done, doing nothing also sucks.",,"['mayor', 'city council', 'nelson', 'sara nelson', 'foster', 'housing', 'homelessness', 'transportation', 'policy', 'development', 'nelson (title)', 'sara nelson (title)', 'foster (title)']",27.5,2025-08-05T19:10:44.336136,6352

Harrell told the Council that an Office of Inspector General (OIG) report supported accusations that Diaz had a romantic relationship with an employee who he hired for a top position at SPD, and then continuously lied about the relationship. In the letter—which Harrell also sent to the City’s police accountability departments, and City Attorney Ann Davison—the mayor said that the OIG report showed Diaz had a romantic relationship with the employee, who he hired through an informal process for a position that had not existed at SPD for sometime, promoted the employee, discussed his sexual relationship with her with other members of SPD, and when confronted about it, denied the relationship existed. Harrell said in the letter that he discussed the findings of the report with Diaz on December 12. Diaz continued to deny a romantic relationship with the employee, but Harrell wrote that he found Diaz’s arguments unpersuasive against the evidence from the OIG: In addition to statements from other SPD employees who said Diaz had told them directly about his romantic relationship with the employee, the OIG investigation turned up a handwritten note from the employee that talked about their romantic relationship. A member of Diaz’s executive protection detail found the note while cleaning a car Diaz used, and the OIG brought in a handwriting expert who said, “it was highly probable,” the note was written by the employee. Given the evidence a romantic relationship between Diaz and the employee had taken place, Harrell found that Diaz’s statements denying the relationship to the Mayor, the public, and SPD command staff violated the department’s policies around dishonesty. Harrell also said that the OIG report found behavior that violated the department’s policies on professionalism, including making “crass and personal statements” about the employee while discussing the intimate relationship with other SPD employees. Harrell called the comments especially “egregious” because Diaz made these statements to his subordinates. Harrell further found Diaz violated policies around conflicts of interest and avoiding improper relationships between supervisors and their subordinates. In the December 12 conversation with Harrell, Diaz maintained that he’d only ever had a platonic relationship with the employee. He also attacked the credibility of witnesses as well as the thoroughness and objectivity of the investigation into his behavior. In particular, Diaz said investigators never reviewed his personal phone records. However, Harrell found Diaz’s arguments unconvincing and pointed out that Diaz had failed to turn over his phone records when an OIG investigator requested them. Diaz’s final departure from SPD comes after a drawn out process that started in May when Harrell demoted Diaz from his position as Chief of Police, leaving him in an amorphous special assignment while allowing him to keep his $370,000 salary. The demotion came amid a smattering of lawsuits accusing Diaz of a culture of racism and sexism at SPD, as well as rumors about his romantic relationship with a subordinate. About a month after his demotion, Diaz went on Jason Rantz’s conservative talk radio show and came out as gay, saying that, if he’d revealed his identity sooner, it might have helped him save his job. OIG opened an investigation into the hiring of the top aide around the time of Diaz stepping down as chief. Then in October, Diaz was placed on administrative leave. Shortly after that he filed a $10 million tort claim against the City. An attorney for Diaz did not immediately return a request for comment. In an email to staff Tuesday, Interim Chief of Police Sue Rahr said Harrell had handled the termination of Diaz and she had no other information to share about it. SPD directed all requests for information about the firing to the Mayor’s Office. In Harrell’s statement regarding the firing of Diaz, he acknowledged the lengthy investigation and called it “robust and thorough."" He added that he looked forward to announcing the City’s next police chief in the near future.",,"['mayor', 'city council', 'harrell', 'bruce harrell', 'davison', 'ann davison', 'police', 'SPD', 'mayor (title)', 'harrell (title)', 'bruce harrell (title)', 'police (title)']",27.5,2025-08-05T19:10:44.309167,4282

The weather is goddamn beautiful—highs in the 80s and sunny—which is a delightful contrast to everything you’re about to read. Let’s do the news. (If you get to the end, there’s some butt jokes, as a treat.) Trump Is Afraid of Teachers: Last week, ICE arrested and detained Fernando Rocha, a theater manager at Juanita High School in Kirkland. His lawyer told the Seattle Times that Rocha entered the US on a tourist visa in 2018, and before it expired, he applied for asylum. The case is still pending. Meanwhile, ICE Seattle claimed on Twitter that Rocha was wanted in Brazil for theft, a claim that his family in Brazil called “outlandish.” Harrell Wants to Watch You Stumble Home Drunk: Or sunbathe in Cal Anderson. Or go to high school. Last week, Harrell and SPD Chief Shon Barnes claimed that the city’s pilot program for their Real Time Crime Center was a roaring success (ok, Batman). The surveillance program put CCTV cameras along Aurora Avenue North, the downtown Third Avenue corridor, and the Chinatown-International District, and integrated them with their favorite new Automated License Plate Readers into a super secret data center (it’s SPD headquarters). Barnes says they’ve assisted in 90 active criminal investigations in 60 days, but didn’t say what the investigations were (we asked and we’ll report back). Now, Harrell wants to do the same in Cal Anderson, the Capitol Hill Night Life District, and Garfield High School. What could go wrong? Serial Rapist Sentenced in Everett: Christian Sayre, a former Everett bar owner, was sentenced to 109 years for 16 counts of second-degree rape, third-degree rape of a child, indecent liberties, and possession of depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Prosecutors say Sayre used his bar in Everett as a staging ground to prey on his victims. Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said in a statement that it was “one of the most complex and disturbing cases” the department has handled. Sayre’s attorney asked that he get 17 and a half years. The prosecutors asked for 133. Judge Millie Judge (not a typo) went with 109, citing the length and breadth of Sayre’s crimes. WA Child Welfare Isn’t So Well: According to the office that oversees the Department of Children, Youth, and Families, critical injuries for kids in the state’s welfare system took a huge jump in the first half of this year. By the end of June, at least 92 children had died or nearly died, up from 78 in the first six months of 2024. Some Republicans are trying to blame the bipartisan Keep Families Together Act, but fentanyl is the likelier culprit. So far this year, 20 of the cases involving kids under 4 years old were caused by accidental fentanyl exposure. Blue Angel Blues: We’re approaching the season when literal fighter jets swoop around our city like a playground, and some Seattleites are over it. The Airshow Climate Action coalition put up a new billboard on Rainier Ave that reads: “SAY NO TO BLUE ANGELS.” Think of the rescue dogs! Think of the military trauma! Or think of the 670 tons of carbon emissions they blow through in one weekend.

As we’ve reported before, the two are neck and neck in fundraising, but we noticed a couple key differences. First, almost $60,000 of Harrell’s donations came from outside of Seattle (the city he’d like to keep governing), compared to Wilson’s $7,207. And among his donors, 19 of them are CEOs. (The only time “chief” comes up in Katie’s donor list is a Chief Policy and Strategy Officer for the Highline School District.) I’m just gonna put this thread from Mark Ostrow here.

She learned a lot. “Before winning me over with an emotional performance of ‘Pearl,’ she had lost me with a megachurch-style sermon about her space voyage,” Vann writes. “She had long dreamed of going to space, she said, and despite her dreams being dismissed, she feels that she ultimately ‘manifested’ her trip on Blue Origin. ‘Part of me did it so that I could let go of any last bit of fear that I had, because I knew that was when my life would begin again,’ she said, tearing up. ‘And to any other girl that has a dream, you go and do it!’ This drew attention to a major discrepancy in her brand regarding female empowerment—she preaches and sings about overcoming adversity (see: ‘Roar and ‘Rise’), but the things she has overcome in her life are deeply unrelatable.” Plus, we got a new list of Katyisms out of the deal: “I’m a Scorpio, bitch!”“Is the internet real, or is this what’s real?”“I dedicate [‘I Kissed A Girl’] to the community—the ones who raised me, the ones that called me out, and the ones that educated me, and for all the little girls in between like myself.”“Love is love! It’s not a gender, it’s a frequency, so tap into it, baby!”“What’s up, Amazon family?” And if you still need a breath before we get into national and international news, spend some time in a basement with The Stranger’s Charles Mudede. Fascism Is Tacky: The administration that populates its Instagram feed with AI-generated images of eagles, money, and the DJT Jerk Off Dance just withdrew from UNESCO, the UN’s cultural agency. This is the second time in as many terms that Trump has pulled us out of the organization. In a comment to the New York Times, a State Department spokesperson accused UNESCO of promoting “divisive social and cultural causes” (Palestinians’ right to exist, mostly) and maintaining an “outsized focus on the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals, a globalist, ideological agenda” at odds “with our America First foreign policy.” Meanwhile, Republicans are trying to rename the Kennedy Center’s Opera House after Melania. Apparently this is art now. No Charges for Bad Cops: You’ve probably seen the video already. Sheriff’s officers in Jacksonville, Florida, pulled William Anthony McNeil Jr. over for not having his headlights on and not wearing a seatbelt. When McNeal questioned why he was pulled over and refused to get out of the car, an officer smashed his window, punched him in the face, wrestled him out of the car, punched him again, and forced him to the ground while shouting “Stop resisting!” Prosecutors say that the officers didn’t break the law, and the Sheriff’s office is still investigating to see if any internal policies were violated. Sheriff T.K. Waters said the cellphone video doesn’t tell the full story. “Cameras can only capture what can be seen and heard,” he said at a news conference Monday. “So much context and depth are absent from recorded footage because a camera simply cannot capture what is known to the people depicted in it.” Don’t worry, T.K., it captured the racism just fine. Israel Strikes WHO Site: Israel attacked a World Health Organization’s site in central Gaza, an area that Israel has largely avoided because it believed Israeli hostages were being held there. Israel doesn’t deny raiding the facility but said any “suspects” had been treated “in accordance with international law.” Whatever the fuck that means at this point. Don’t Put That Up There: A Tokyo-based designer made a butt plug bottle with an egg-shaped, rounded bottom designed to nestle into the sand on the beach, and presented it at the 2nd International Conference on Design for Ocean Environments, which sounds very respectable.

Good Morning! The weather is goddamn beautiful—highs in the 80s and sunny—which is a delightful contrast to everything you’re about to read. Let’s do the news. (If you get to the end, there’s some butt jokes, as a treat.) Trump Is Afraid of Teachers: Last week, ICE arrested and detained Fernando Rocha, a theater manager at Juanita High School in Kirkland. His lawyer told the Seattle Times that Rocha entered the US on a tourist visa in 2018, and before it expired, he applied for asylum. The case is still pending. Meanwhile, ICE Seattle claimed on Twitter that Rocha was wanted in Brazil for theft, a claim that his family in Brazil called “outlandish.” Harrell Wants to Watch You Stumble Home Drunk: Or sunbathe in Cal Anderson. Or go to high school. Last week, Harrell and SPD Chief Shon Barnes claimed that the city’s pilot program for their Real Time Crime Center was a roaring success (ok, Batman). The surveillance program put CCTV cameras along Aurora Avenue North, the downtown Third Avenue corridor, and the Chinatown-International District, and integrated them with their favorite new Automated License Plate Readers into a super secret data center (it’s SPD headquarters). Barnes says they’ve assisted in 90 active criminal investigations in 60 days, but didn’t say what the investigations were (we asked and we’ll report back). Now, Harrell wants to do the same in Cal Anderson, the Capitol Hill Night Life District, and Garfield High School. What could go wrong? Serial Rapist Sentenced in Everett: Christian Sayre, a former Everett bar owner, was sentenced to 109 years for 16 counts of second-degree rape, third-degree rape of a child, indecent liberties, and possession of depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Prosecutors say Sayre used his bar in Everett as a staging ground to prey on his victims. Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said in a statement that it was “one of the most complex and disturbing cases” the department has handled. Sayre’s attorney asked that he get 17 and a half years. The prosecutors asked for 133. Judge Millie Judge (not a typo) went with 109, citing the length and breadth of Sayre’s crimes. WA Child Welfare Isn’t So Well: According to the office that oversees the Department of Children, Youth, and Families, critical injuries for kids in the state’s welfare system took a huge jump in the first half of this year. By the end of June, at least 92 children had died or nearly died, up from 78 in the first six months of 2024. Some Republicans are trying to blame the bipartisan Keep Families Together Act, but fentanyl is the likelier culprit. So far this year, 20 of the cases involving kids under 4 years old were caused by accidental fentanyl exposure. Blue Angel Blues: We’re approaching the season when literal fighter jets swoop around our city like a playground, and some Seattleites are over it. The Airshow Climate Action coalition put up a new billboard on Rainier Ave that reads: “SAY NO TO BLUE ANGELS.” Think of the rescue dogs! Think of the military trauma! Or think of the 670 tons of carbon emissions they blow through in one weekend.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/07/30/80172726/a-conservative-out-of-state-pac-is-backing-sara-nelson,The Stranger (Web),A Conservative Out-of-State PAC Is Backing Sara Nelson Just Can't Get Enough?,"A little more than a week before Seattle’s primary election, the National Association of Realtors, a Chicago-based political action committee, spent nearly $70,000 on mailers for Council President Sara Nelson’s bid to stay on the Seattle City Council. In mailers sponsored by the interest group that only issued an apology in 2020 for its racist funding of the opposition to housing inclusion including the Fair Housing Act of 1968, the NAR calls Nelson a politician with “progressive values.” Progressive? Her? This influx of money and influence is meant to counter Nelson’s extreme unpopularity. Polling in May found that 34 percent of voters disapproved of her job performance. And when voters were surveyed last week, pollsters found that Nelson and her leading opposition, Dionne Foster, are in a dead heat. This is why Progressive People Power, or P3, a political action committee for, you guessed it, progressive values launched last year to support the more progressive candidate in each race. Last year, it was mainly Alexis Mercedes Rinck, who won in a landslide. This year, there is an entire slate of progressive candidates as we head into voting season. “Those candidates work really hard and rise above the fold to get into the general election and then walk face first into a meat grinder of massive corporate spending that drowns out their message and makes it impossible for them to win,” Stephen Paolini, a consultant with P3 says. Since P3 doesn’t endorse, the group’s rule of thumb is to not get involved in the primary. However, P3 is breaking that rule in the District 9 council race against Nelson. Foster is participating in the Democracy Voucher Program, and has raised $290,756.83 in the primary. Nelson's campaign has raised more than $423,000 before the primary, already 70 percent of what she raised between the primary and the general in 2021. And 17 percent of that is from outside of Seattle. Many of her individual contributors are wealth managers, investors, and developers. The $70,000 of PAC money from the NAR (separate from her campaign war chest) isn’t the end, Paolini believes. He thinks it’s only the beginning. “We knew going into this that this would be a heavyweight fight where the business community would be coming in here and writing a blank check to try and keep what has been an extremely unpopular council president in office,” Paolini says, “and we felt it was really important for us to stand up and fight back.” So P3 broke with their (albeit one-year) tradition and began funneling money and resources into Nelson challenger and policy expert Dionne Foster’s campaign weeks before the primary. “This was a race where it’s super clear there's one person that we need to help elevate and support and who's going to be outspent by these out of state groups,” Paolini says. And the group supporting Nelson is one that historically goes ride or die for NIMBYism. At a time when Seattle is dictating the future of Seattle’s development with the Comprehensive Plan, that kind of interest from the NAR may indicate Nelson’s real positions on housing and density. “This is the mask off moment if anybody was wondering what her values truly are,” Paolini says. Likely, nobody was wondering. But, on the flip side, these efforts to beat Foster emphasize her values as well. The people who have funded her confirm that, too. P3 has spent nearly $80,000 on Foster’s behalf so far. According to Paolini, the money P3 spent in this election took over a year to raise from their collaboration with unions and individual donors. Meanwhile, Paolini says groups like NAR can drop that same figure with a snap of a CEO’s fingers. “We need help from, like, lots of people to keep trying to stand up against this kind of powerhouse of an entity,” Paolini says. Editor's Note: A previous version misstated the total contributions Sara Nelson has received. It also stated that Dionne Foster could not spend more than $225,000 on the primary. The campaign informed us after publication that their spending cap has been lifted.",,"['city council', 'election', 'candidate', 'nelson', 'sara nelson', 'foster', 'housing', 'policy', 'development', 'nelson (title)', 'sara nelson (title)']",25.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.340924,4057
https://www.thestranger.com/last-month-this-month/2025/07/01/80126501/last-month-this-month,The Stranger (Web),Last Month This Month Just Can't Get Enough?,"Last Month This Month is a recap of all the previous month's news, featuring headlines from Slog AM. Find it in every issue of The Stranger! Subscribe to our daily Slog AM newsletter here. This story originally appeared in our Primary Endorsements Issue on July 2, 2025. June was full of ups and downs. Donald Trump threw a $45 million birthday party; no one came to Donald Trump’s $45 million birthday party. Greta Thunberg went to Gaza; Greta Thunberg was detained in Gaza. A war between Israel and Iran began; a war between Israel and Iran ended. Here’s what else happened last month: * * * The Navy, which isn’t gay at all, started the month by announcing plans to take gay civil rights hero Harvey Milk’s name off a ship. The Pentagon said in a statement that all Department of Defense names should reflect three things: Trump’s priorities, US history, and the “warrior ethos.” So butch. The Navy is also considering new names for the USNS Thurgood Marshall (too Black), the USNS Ruth Bader Ginsburg (too woman), the USNS Harriet Tubman (too Black and too woman), who literally fought in the US Civil War. * * * The same week that the Supreme Court upheld a Tennessee law that bans puberty blockers, hormones and (the rare) surgery for minors, the Trump Administration announced they would be cutting the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline’s LGBTQ Youth Specialized Service, effective July 17. As Abe Asher wrote in our Queer Issue in June, the Trevor Project saw a “700-percent increase in young people reaching out to crisis services” the day after November’s election. How nice of the feds to take our calls through Pride Month. The Trevor Project will continue to offer 24/7 help 365 days a year to folks 24 and younger, via text, phone, and online chat, and the Trans Lifeline is also available by calling 877-565-8860 or visiting translifeline.org. If you want to really piss Trump and RFK Jr. off, you can also donate to both organizations online. Fuck your conditional federal funding, assholes. * * * In other wrinkly old dickbag news, Amsterdam’s national Rijksmuseum is displaying what is believed to be the world’s oldest condom. Historians say it was fashioned from a sheep’s appendix sometime around 1830, which hits so right for Shepherd/Flock play. The 200-year-old prophylactic even has a kinky little illustration showing a nun with her habit hiked up (with no underwear in sight) and three clergymen who’ve lifted their robes to present three rock-hard erections, in case its use wasn’t clear. Unrelated, remember when people used to draw dicks in text like this? 8==D * * * The Seattle City Council almost voted to toss our ethics code in the wastebasket. If their “reform” passed, it would have allowed councilmembers to vote on issues that benefited them, so long as they disclosed conflicts to the public. After weeks of protests and thousands of emails and public comments opposing the change, Councilmember Cathy Moore withdrew the bill before the vote could happen. The people were heard! Immediately afterwards, Moore also announced she would be stepping down just a year and a half into her four-year term, citing health issues. Moore is the second councilmember to leave her position early this year—Tammy Morales vacated her seat in January. Confidential to all CMs we endorse in this month’s issue: If you win, DON’T FUCKING QUIT. * * * While Moore’s quitting, Rob Saka’s yelling at clouds curbs. Again. In a 2,100-word email newsletter, Saka lost his ever-loving mind about the people who opposed his pet curb project. He accused the people who opposed removing an eight-inch curb that blocks illegal left turns into his kids’ preschool of, somehow, simultaneously: supporting Trump’s anti-immigrant policies, being part of the “Defund the Police” movement, and partaking in “White Saviorism” (capitalization his). Someone take his computer away and give him a paper bag to breathe into. * * * When they weren’t quitting or screaming at concrete, the Seattle City Council was productive. Some good moves, some bad. In the bad column: they voted 8-1 to approve SPD’s use of StarChase’s GPS launcher and passed a bill to install privately owned 8-foot-tall digital advertising kiosks throughout the city. In the good column, they voted unanimously to pass a ban on rent-setting software like RealPage. * * * There were No Kings protests in all 50 states, and the ACLU estimates that at least 5 million people hit the streets. They were largely peaceful rallies, with the exception of Salt Lake City’s. There, according to police, 24-year-old Arturo Gamboa had an AR-15-style rifle in his backpack. Two armed, non-police “peacekeepers” saw Gamboa lift the gun as if to shoot it, and one of them shot him, also accidentally shooting and killing a fashion designer named Arthur “Afa” Folasa Ah Loo in the process. Everyone involved is in custody, and everyone would be better off if we had better gun-control laws. * * * The US has detained a record-breaking number of immigrants. By the end of June, more than 56,000 people were locked up in ICE facilities, and, according to one Syracuse professor, more than a third have zero criminal records. This is fucked. The ICE arrests are so rampant that organizers cancelled this year’s Duwamish River Festival because participants are concerned about being targeted by immigration enforcement. A glimmer of good in the nightmare: Lewelyn Dixon, a Filipino green-card holder who worked at the University of Washington, was able to go home after a judge ruled she doesn’t qualify for deportation. * * * Leopards are eating faces over there in Redmond. Microsoft is planning to lay off thousands of employees in July as it funnels spending into artificial intelligence (John Connor, where are you?). This news comes after the company already axed 6,000 jobs in May. Washington State University also announced layoffs—the school plans to cut “a little over 4 percent (more than $17 million)” from its budget. And SIFF’s struggling, too; the org laid off nine full-time workers across multiple departments. SIFF Executive Director Tom Mara wrote the 21-percent reduction in administrative staff was “necessary” during a “financially challenging time for SIFF and for arts nonprofits across the country.” Oh, and Din Tai Fung did wage theft and everyone who works at the Louvre fucking hates the Mona Lisa. * * * Too on the nose? On June 18, while Trump weighed the pros and cons of getting involved in the Israel–Iran conflict (which he eventually did, without talking to Congress, which is illegal), an unmanned SpaceX spaceship blew the fuck up. This is not supposed to happen in rocket science, we’re told. * * * Jeffrey Bezos and his alive girl Lauren Sanchez are finally tying the knot. They are doing so by—checks notes—renting out the entire island of Venice? Protesters chased the billionaires from their original venue by threatening to fill the canals with inflatable crocodiles. (Or was it alligators? None of us are from Florida and we do not know the difference.) Too bad the foam party on Bezos’s $500 million superyacht off the coast of Europe couldn’t be stopped. Those grainy images of a shirtless, foamy Bezos in a bucket hat need to be scrubbed from our minds.",,"['city council', 'councilmember', 'election', 'morales', 'tammy morales', 'budget', 'police', 'SPD', 'workers']",23.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.341924,7269
https://www.thestranger.com/news/2024/12/23/79839659/king-county-metro-bus-driver-shawn-yims-death-is-a-tragedy,The Stranger (Web),King County Metro Bus Driver Shawn Yim’s Death Is a Tragedy Just Can't Get Enough?,"On Saturday, Seattle Police Department (SPD) officers arrested a man suspected of killing King County Metro bus driver Shawn Yim, a tragedy marked over the weekend with a vigil at the scene of his death in the University District. The attack represented the first killing of a Metro bus driver in 26 years. The King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office released details about the attack over the weekend. Just before 3 am on December 18, Yim picked up two passengers from a bus stop on 15th Avenue and 43rd Street NE, directly across from the University of Washington campus. As one of the passengers boarded, he closed a bus window. This sparked an argument between Yim and the passenger: Yim said the window needed to stay open to prevent the glass from fogging up, while the passenger said he was cold. Yim drove just two blocks before stopping to close the window. According to court documents, the argument escalated and Yim ultimately told the man to exit the bus. The man then walked up to Yim, and allegedly pepper sprayed him, before stepping off the bus. Yim followed and the man sprayed Yim again, allegedly kicked him, and then walked away. Yim continued to trail the man, calling 911 and saying a passenger had attacked him. Yim told dispatch, “Hurry please … he’s fleeing.” Surveillance video showed Yim following the man for about a minute, before the man turned around and the two began to fight. The man allegedly stabbed Yim about 10 times before walking away, leaving Yim on the ground. Less than a minute later, the other passenger from the bus can be seen on surveillance video checking on Yim. He told police that Yim already appeared unresponsive at that point. Yim’s death spurred a manhunt and a flurry of news articles. KOMO described how the man suspected of stabbing Yim had dragged the driver off the bus, which turned out to be false. Multiple outlets blasted out the suspect’s name and photo after SPD posted it online. Others, such as The Stranger and the Seattle Times, refrained from naming the suspect prior to prosecutors filing formal charges, which the King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office (KCPAO) finally did Monday, charging 53-year-old Richard Sitzlack with murder. The KCPAO spokesperson Casey McNerthney said his office and SPD detectives became aware of Sitzlack last year when SPD officers arrested him for murder in connection to the stabbing death of his roommate in November 2023. Prosecutors never filed formal charges however, and McNerthney said while police investigators initially had doubts about Sitzlack’s claim of self-defense, he said further investigation seemed to support Sitzlack’s story. In the hours after the stabbing, King County Officials such as King County Executive Dow Constantine, officials from King County Metro, and representatives with the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 587, held a press conference about Yim’s death. The union called for an expansion of the transit police force and for the installation of protective cages for drivers. The union’s president, Greg Woodfill, argued the county and the region haven't done enough to keep drivers safe. Over the last two decades, assaults against Metro bus drivers have generally decreased from the highs of the early 2000s, such as in 2006 when drivers reported 189 assaults in one year. In 2018, with daily ridership close to about 400,000, the number of assaults hovered at about 81 that year, with 40 of those incidents involving passengers spitting on drivers. With daily ridership sitting just below 300,000 in 2023, there were 34 assaults, nine of which involved spitting. As of November this year, Metro has recorded just 15 assaults even as daily ridership continues to rebound since the pandemic. That said, some drivers have busier routes, may have faced multiple assaults over their time at Metro, and many drivers view this as a cumulative issue, and not easily quantified. The number of assaults directly against drivers is one statistic and it doesn’t encapsulate all the times drivers felt unsafe on their buses. Bus drivers deal with passengers fighting, people overdosing, and, in general, people kind of sucking sometimes. Even before Yim's death, it became clear something had come to a head for drivers when last week Metro announced that it planned to close its stops at 12th Avenue and Jackson Street because of potential dangers to its drivers and passengers. Yim's death led to renewed calls from the drivers' union for better barriers to protect them from attacks and random riders' spit. At the same time, the union’s demands for more transit police seems like a way to exacerbate the issue of people becoming more agitated in this City, and create more hostility to people in poverty. In particular, the city’s police force seems already predisposed to be hostile to the homeless. Kristina Sawyckyi happened to be handing out meals in the University District as cops searched for the suspect in the stabbing. She described watching as members of law enforcement approached homeless people hanging near bus stops and started shining flashlights in their faces. She said she heard the officers yelling about how homeless people in Seattle commit so much crime and are a burden and a problem. SPD spokesperson Eric Muñoz said he was on scene the day of the stabbing and he was “not aware of any of this.” SPD officers, KCSO deputies, and UW Police Officers all helped with the search, he said and he cannot speak for what any officers may have said during that time. Greg Kim with the Seattle Times just wrote an excellent piece about how Mayor Bruce Harrell’s plans to clean up downtown have yielded major results along Third Avenue in the last two months. Kim described how a combination of arrests and street ""cleanings"" have led to a lower number of reported crimes, calls for drug activity, and people on the streets. But as Kim said, the disorder ""didn’t go far."" Kim pointed out how as Third Avenue calmed down, issues in the Chinatown International District simultaneously surged, and gave examples such as the stabbing that injured nine people in November. Kim describes how police have become more physical with people living homeless on Third Avenue, grabbing them by the shirt, and making them feel unwelcome. However, these individuals are often pushed into Little Saigon, right near where Metro had to close the 12th Avenue and Jackson Street bus stops. These policies don’t reduce poverty and addiction; they simply keep people struggling with these concerns constantly on the move. And the easiest, cheapest way to move around this city is public transit. And while in the coming days, many people will stress that public transit is generally safe, the other point to remember is that people are generally safe too. Including the people on public transit who make you uncomfortable with their mental illness and poverty. However, even a typically safe person, when dealing with constant instability, fear, and violence, may lash out during a particularly bad day. (That said, unhoused people are far more likely to be the victims of a violent crime than the perpetrators.) And look, I don't know much about this Sitzlack guy, and whether the city could have done something to prevent this tragedy. I wish I did. What I do know is that the more this city treats the homeless and the people struggling with addiction like criminals, rather than a population who need services, money, and evidence-based support, the deeper the city pushes them into poverty, illness, and crime. Instead of increasing police, we should focus on improving the lives of our citizens.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/05/02/80039738/the-downfall-of-the-climate-savior-who-never-was,The Stranger (Web),The Downfall of the Climate Savior Who Never Was Just Can't Get Enough?,"There’s a special glee in watching the real-time, self-induced demise of the world’s richest man. Elon Musk, once crowned the boy-king of tech utopianism, has become a tragicomic emblem of what happens when unfettered power meets zero accountability and even less empathy. On Wall Street, his house of electric cards is collapsing: Tesla profits are down 71 percent, shareholders are restless, and even the once-smitten business press are using words like “panic.” And this week, Tesla’s notoriously sycophantic board reportedly—if only for a fleeting moment—considered the heretical notion of replacing him as CEO. In Washington, his soon to be concluded reign as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) leaves a legacy of bureaucratic arson: mass firings, dismantled aid programs, and a chainsaw routine at CPAC that felt like ketamine-laced performance. And still, with the bodies of his bad decisions piling up behind him, Musk went on Fox News to cry about how unfair it all is. He’s no better than a plantation boss bemoaning the loss of free labor, or a robber baron lamenting the bad press after forcefully putting down a strike. Yet, he dares to ask for sympathy. But this isn’t just the fall of a tycoon. No, it’s the flailing, unhinged collapse of a worldview: one that treats governance like a meme, human beings like data points, and compassion as a virus to be eradicated. It wasn’t that long ago that Elon Musk was the liberal poster child for Green capitalism, the magical thinking that climate change, economic stagnation, and job scarcity could all be solved by sleek electric cars and billionaire jaunts to space. In 2015, President Obama used his penultimate State of the Union address to give Musk and his companies a glowing verbal body rub for pushing green tech innovation. Two years earlier, Obama’s Department of Energy handed Tesla a $465 million taxpayer-backed loan, which helped the automaker finally post a profit in 2013. And while liberals went apeshit when Trump turned the White House lawn into a literal “Tesla showroom” during a March event, it’s worth remembering Obama personally toured a SpaceX facility back in 2010 to show his love for public-private bromance in aerospace and renewables. Even before his courtship with the Obama administration, Musk had been glazed by progressive institutions, honored by the National Wildlife Federation, and handed the Global Green Product Design Award by none other than Mikhail Gorbachev. And before he cozied up to Trump, Musk made a brief show of conscience by quitting Trump’s advisory councils over the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord. He even declared “climate change is real” and called the move “not good for America or the world.” Naturally, that principled defiance didn’t stick. And now, Musk’s favorability rating, among everyone, not just liberals, is nestled somewhere between shingles and prostate cancer. His Teslas are dotted with Nazi insignias, and protests against him and his dealerships grow by the week. Besides gifting us gems like “Elon can oligargle dez nutz,” the nationwide protests against the world's richest man may have been the official nail in the coffin in the collective hallucinations that Green capitalism was ever a panacea for our climate and labor crisis, and that Elon Musk was ever anything more than a self-enriching opportunist. “I think the days when people thought we could solve the climate change and crisis by driving an overpriced Tesla are dead,” jokes Thea Riofrancos, Strategic Co-Director of the Climate and Community Institute. Alas, we deified Musk, only for him to unsurprisingly be revealed as a false messiah. There’s already been plenty written about Musk and his fellow tech overlords (Bezos, Zuckerberg, Andreessen), and whether they were always oligarchs in disguise, ready to buddy up beside a conveniently right-wing government (a hard yes on that one). Musk is who he’s always been, which is the same as all high-level capitalists: a self-important, mendacious fuck, willing to choose whatever path is most beneficial to him, all others be damned. As much as we’ve all basked in the collective schadenfreude over the past month—watching Teslas and Cyber Trucks get defaced with Nazi swastikas (which, for the record, is not a hate crime, no matter what the New York Times may suggest), it’s hard not to feel a little twinge of collective complicity. After all, we did allow taxpayer money to flow straight into his pockets in the first place. With Musk, we convinced ourselves we were investing in a climate Messiah, the next ""great man"" who would steer us toward a utopian green future. We imagined he would be the hero of the climate crisis, the one who would save us from ourselves. Instead, we handed him the keys to unfathomable wealth, elevating him to the point where he now wields influence on par with the president. And what does he do with that power? He uses it to decimate anything that threatens his stranglehold on the future. We didn’t bankroll a savior, we created a monster. A monster who has turned the very tools of democracy that enriched him, into weapons to dismantle democracy itself. As the Washington Post recently reported, Musk primarily built his fortune and business empire from $38 billion in public coffers, both from federal and local governments. In fact, he's drawing from the trough again as he stands to be rewarded handsomely from Trump's recently proposed $1 trillion Pentagon budget, which will enrich musk and other defense contractors, while education, arts, Medicaid, Social Security, health and everything else, not in the purview of our oligarchic overlords, stands to suffer. Of course, perhaps it's simply the playbook of most rapacious capitalists propelled up a ladder through luck, stomping on the hands of others and assistance through the public purse, only to set fire to the thing, scorching it whole behind them once they reach the top. “Tesla and SpaceX would not exist today without help from the government. People need to bear that in mind, when governments give tax breaks to billionaires, that means governments either need to spend less on other things, like schools, healthcare, and housing, or they need to raise taxes on the rest of us, so we end up paying for Musk largesse,"" says Jonathan Rosenblum, a longtime labor activist and union organizer with UAW. To Rosenblum’s point, Musk has been draining public resources long before he “volunteered” to lead the Department of Government Efficiency. Every dollar handed to Musk is a dollar diverted from essential public services: schools, transit, and healthcare. The opportunity cost of those subsidies isn’t abstract; it’s real, and it goes straight into his pockets. And it’s done at the expense of workers and unions. “Doge is merely accelerating this track record of theft. In protesting the Tesla brand, people are properly drawing the connection between Musk’s obscene wealth and his thieving ways,” says Rosenblum. It’s true that few have taken more and given less back to the public than Musk. After receiving billions in taxpayer support, Musk has built a business model on suppressing worker organizing. From illegally firing union supporters at Tesla’s California plant to targeting software workers in New York, his managers have followed a consistent playbook of intimidation and retaliation. “People are rightfully angry that the richest man in the world is collaborating with the most powerful man in the world to steal our retirements, our healthcare, and our educational opportunities. Musk is obscenely rich today in part because of the massive public subsidies he has pursued aggressively over the years,” says Rosenblum. Along with other rapacious billionaires, Musk has also led a full assault on the National Labor Relations Board over the last two years. Through his companies, Tesla, SpaceX, and X, he’s repeatedly violated labor law: threatening Tesla workers with the loss of stock options if they unionize, banning union t-shirts on the factory floor, and illegally firing employees at SpaceX and X for organizing or speaking out. These violations led to multiple rulings from the NLRB against Musk’s companies. But instead of complying with the law, he chose a path that reflects a long American tradition: when the rules don’t serve the powerful, fuck it, dismantle the rules altogether. Through SpaceX, Musk filed a federal lawsuit challenging the very constitutionality of the NLRB, which was created during the New Deal to ensure that working people, especially the most underrepresented, had a voice in the workplace. Make no mistake, this wasn’t just a legal maneuver; it was an ideological assault aimed at erasing one of the few remaining tools of federal protection for labor rights. It’s a stark reminder that in this country, the powerful often see accountability as optional, and when facing it, will do everything they can to rewrite the terms of democracy in their favor. Today, Tesla stands as the largest non-union auto manufacturer in the U.S. It’s become a model of how to scale production while locking workers out of a voice on the job. Nor is this just a domestic issue. Tesla has refused to sign collective bargaining agreements even in union-strong countries like Germany and Sweden. That’s what we’re subsidizing with our public dollars: a global campaign against workers' rights. Tesla, despite ranking ninth in earnings among U.S. automakers, commands a $1.25 trillion valuation, largely propped up by the aforementioned public subsidies. A functioning NLRB threatens that business model by giving workers a say in how those government-supported workplaces operate. By working hand in hand with Trump, Musk is pushing an agenda that would gut the NLRB, firing judges, paralyzing enforcement, and rendering union protections meaningless. The goal is clear: create a legal and political environment where companies like Tesla and SpaceX can violate labor law with impunity, silencing workers while continuing to extract billions from the public. If Musk succeeds, it won’t just be his workers who suffer, it will be a decisive blow to what little remains of labor rights in the private sector. What we’re seeing is a coordinated attack on the labor law infrastructure itself, with Musk playing a leading role. With Trump openly dismantling collective bargaining rights for federal workers, nominating anti-union lawyers like Crystal Carey to the NLRB, and firing Board members like Gwynne Wilcox to disable its function, corporate America is being given the green light to ignore labor law altogether. Utah’s recent ban on public sector bargaining and the Michigan case where an employer refused to recognize a union election, citing the chaos at the NLRB, are early signs of what’s to come. Employers like Musk are watching closely and acting quickly. If the courts uphold this unraveling of the NLRB’s authority, we won’t just witness more union-busting, we’ll see the total erosion of the right to organize in America. “Unions, when they’re doing the right thing, are the most effective force for change,” says Kate Bronfenbrenner, a labor scholar at Cornell University and leading expert on unionizing strategies. That’s exactly why she says Musk sees unions as such a threat. His attack on them follows the standard anti-union playbook: surveil, delay, intimidate, retaliate, and then challenge legal frameworks. What sets Musk apart is that he’s scaled up these tactics using the vast resources of his corporate empire along with leveraging the machinery of government to further erode labor protections. “He’s firing people in these agencies meant to keep corporations accountable so that there won’t be any checks and balances,” Bronfenbrenner says. Musk is attempting to deliver the death blow to a labor movement that’s been under attack for decades. The decline didn’t start with him; it was set in motion under Democratic administrations that claimed to support workers while advancing trade deals, deregulation, and immigration policies that weakened labor’s power. Bronfenbrenner is quick to point out that neither President Obama nor Clinton were true friends of labor. The former was the “deporter-in-chief” of immigrant workers, and the latter spearheaded NAFTA, which undermined organized labor and decimated working-class jobs in America. “Unions haven’t been holding Democrats accountable. They’ve been so scared of having anti-union folks in office that they take for granted that Dems will do right by them,” she says. “We can’t dance around the subject anymore. Labor has to have its own party and educate workers.” This is why, at a time when only 6% of private sector workers are in unions—compared to 32% in the public sector—she argues that the public must be educated on what fascist authoritarians of the past did to labor. Figures like Franco and Hitler didn’t just target marginalized communities; they first dismantled unions, understanding that weakening labor was the first step toward unleashing full-scale assaults on broader societal freedoms. “Unions have to stand up for trans workers, and immigrants. The rank and file can’t start thinking they’re safe, they aren’t. They have to have the courage to stand up and be in front of this struggle,” she says. Public protesting and shaming are fine, but what workers and the general public really need to do, according to Bronfenbrenner, is truly hit Tesla, and all corporations that would assail labor rights, where it hurts. “We have to use power, not shame. We have to interfere with supply chains. Whatever you’re doing has to cost enough to a corporation for it to do the right thing,” she says. But the fight against Musk, and whatever corporate misanthrope will come after him, ultimately boils down to whether labor can convince enough of the public that their flourishing is dependent on a greener and more democratic future. “Can’t assume workers want a revolution. Workers want better lives,” says Bronfenbrenner.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/05/23/80070168/whats-behind-the-gilded-doors-of-aegis-senior-living,The Stranger (Web),What’s Behind the Gilded Doors of Aegis Senior Living? Just Can't Get Enough?,"If you’ve seen old folks’ homes with a certain Cheesecake Factory aesthetic popping up around Washington, you know Aegis Living. A private pay assisted living chain that does not accept Medicare, Aegis owns $2.5 billion in property across Washington, California, and Nevada, including 23 “luxury” senior living centers in the Seattle area. Aegis’ CEO claims that the company brings in nearly $250 million in annual operating revenues from resident costs that can climb into the tens of thousands of dollars per month. Living at Aegis appears to be worth it, though: in March, their Greenwood facility was named the number one senior living facility in the country. With Medicaid cuts threatening to shut down many of our elder care facilities in the Pacific Northwest, there’s never been a better time to get to know our local retirement home landlord. To understand Aegis Living, you need to know about Dwayne J. Clark, the charismatic CEO driving the company’s vision. Clark has done a good job of building his mythology. In puff pieces like his most recent in Seattle Magazine, he talks about a childhood marked by hardship: His father left when he was five, and Clark’s mother raised him and his three siblings in Lewiston, ID, before relocating to Spokane, WA. He and his three siblings didn’t have much. In a story Clark recounts often, his family struggled so badly once that his mother, a line cook at the Elks Lodge in Lewiston, smuggled home a handful of potatoes from work and turned them into soup that sustained the family for a week. If you believe his PR efforts, Dwayne J. Clark was a bootstrappin’ young kid who was so inspired by his mother’s hardships that he made it his life’s mission to give our aging seniors more dignified lives—a serious and noble endeavor. But the truth is uglier. And weirder. It appears Clark is another classic American huckster who repeats half-truths and outright fabrications, never letting the truth get in the way of a good story while he does the opposite of what he claims: making elder care less accessible and making a fortune on the backs of underpaid workers. Inside Clark’s gaudy Aegis facilities are vulnerable elderly folks paying exorbitant costs to be treated by a constantly revolving team of low-paid workers and third-party contractors, causing dangerous conditions that have led to multimillion-dollar lawsuits, hundreds of complaints to the state, felony criminal charges—and questions about who will take care of us when we get old. Who Dreams of Owning Elder Care Facilities? In podcasts, interviews, and on his website, Clark says he bounced around a while as a young adult, studying at Chaminade University in Hawaii and then Gonzaga, before ultimately dropping out. Clark says he then drifted through a series of dead end jobs including a particularly intense-sounding one at the Washington State Penitentiary. “I worked in the criminal justice system at a maximum-security prison in Walla Walla,” he told Seattle Magazine. “I carried a gun and went through Washington station training. I was on a tactical unit that would disrupt people that were taken hostage.” He told the American Seniors Housing Association that around that time, his sister told him to look into the aging population of America and consider getting into the soon-to-be booming industry of elder care. Clark interviewed with a business in that field, and after working there a few years, he started Aegis Living with a business partner in 1997. ""Our priority is to build in the most exclusive markets we can, with the highest barriers of entry, so it will be a long time before the competition comes in behind us,” Clark told the Puget Sound Business Journal in 2002. “We want to be in the highest-wealth cities in the US."" That business model is obvious to everyone around the empire. “It just seems like so much of it is designed to separate people from their life savings,” says Will Brattain, a former certified nursing assistant (CNA) at Aegis Ravenna from July 2022 to February 2024. “You need this, you don't really know what your options are, this seems like the best bet, and then all of a sudden you're paying $12,000 a month and there goes your house and there goes everything that you've accumulated over the years, your children's inheritances. It's all just getting sucked up by Dwayne.” Violet Lawler, a former employee at top-rated Aegis Greenwood, was in the room for a mandatory presentation from Clark at her workplace in 2023. Afterward when she chatted with him he was polite and seemingly willing to discuss any topic. She was curious about Aegis’ high costs, which are roughly four times the national average for assisted living communities and can climb as high as $30,000 per month for residents and their families depending on the level of care provided. Violet Lawler says she asked Clark, “Have you ever considered building a community that's more catered to the middle class?” Clark’s demeanor quickly changed, she says. “We looked into it,” he said. “There’s no money in it.” Then, she says, he walked away. Neither Clark nor Aegis Living responded to The Stranger’s multiple requests for comment. The Benevolent Billionaire In Clark’s many interviews, podcast appearances, and social media posts, the subtext is clear: Trust me, I’ll take good care of your aging family members. With Seattle’s aging population, more of us will depend on facilities like Clark’s, and it feels good to be told we’ll be in good hands when we can’t take care of ourselves. But are we? Let’s start at the top, with Clark. Clark presents himself as a bit of a hero, who worked hard, pulled himself up by his bootstraps, and found a way to make a difference in elder care. Remember how Clark said when he was younger, he worked at a “maximum-security prison,” “carried a gun,” and would “disrupt people that were taken hostage”? The Department of Corrections has no records of a Dwayne Clark ever working around that time at the Washington State Penitentiary, the only maximum-security prison in Walla Walla. Same for the Walla Walla Police Department. In fact, according to the city of Walla Walla, during that time period, no one named Dwayne Clark worked for the city in any capacity. He doesn’t hide his wealth: At the Aegis “home office” in Bellevue, Clark displays a motorcycle reportedly once owned by deceased actor Robin Williams. For his annual Christmas party, he lines up his collection of Lamborghinis and Ferraris around the circular driveway at his mansion in Medina. Clark presents himself as the human embodiment of Aegis’ success, showcasing photos on his website with former presidents, billionaire CEO’s, and celebrities. But he wants you to believe that he gives a great deal of it away to the less fortunate: a benevolent billionaire. One of the good ones. On his website, Clark writes, “The Clark Family Foundation was founded in 2017 to care for the most vulnerable people in society. Its major focus is on elderly and children.” However, tax forms show the foundation functions primarily as a way for Clark to funnel money to well-funded private schools on the Eastside. The foundation’s most recent tax returns show that in 2023, it only made two donations—$50,000 to Eastside Catholic high school in Sammamish, one of the most expensive high schools in the area; and $200,000 to St Thomas, an elite K-8 school in ritzy Medina—and carried into 2024 nearly $1.5 million dollars of undistributed funding. Maybe next year they will get to “the most vulnerable people in society.” His Queen Bee Cafe, formerly a chain with locations in Seattle, now has only one shop in the bougie Clyde Hill neighborhood in Bellevue, where it proudly displays above its front door, “YOU DINE. WE DONATE.” Its website claims, “We are a not-for-profit café. 100% of our proceeds benefit local charities selected each year. So feel good! Because one cup at a time, together we’re making a difference.” The organization isn’t registered as a non-profit in Washington state, instead functioning as an LLC owned by Aegis. As a not-for-profit, Queen Bee Cafe isn’t required to disclose where they donate their money. But one would assume the organization would be at least somewhat transparent, given such a loud declaration of “YOU DINE. WE DONATE.” However, Queen Bee Cafe doesn’t make specific information about their donations public, instead offering a list of charities on their website they claim they’ve donated to since the cafe opened. But none of the charities listed on Queen Bee Cafe’s website confirmed ever receiving more than $20,000 in a year from Aegis. A representative from the Greater Seattle Business Association Scholarship Fund—the only organization who would speak on the record about Queen Bee Cafe’s donation history— confirmed that despite being listed on their website, the GSBA hasn’t received any donations from Queen Bee Cafe since 2017. And from 2015 to 2017, they only received a paltry total of $1,767. Clark's political donations are some of the only transparent proof of his “charity,” including many donations to conservative candidates like John McCain, Marco Rubio, Dave Reichert, and in 2023 over $13,000 to Nikki Haley. He has personally given $24,000 to American Senior Housing Association, a Political Action Committee that donates to Republican candidates who advocate for the end of Medicare. His most recent donation was in December 2024. And then there’s The Potato Soup Foundation. Remember the story Clark tells about a lean period growing up when his family ate potato soup for a week? Clark claims during that time his mother told him, “Now I don’t want you to forget, employees have needs just like we’re having this need right now and, you always need to be there for your employees and they’ll always be there for you.” Let’s just assume we live in a universe where she actually did say that. Clark seems to have taken away a strange lesson. Instead of directing some of the company’s profits toward employees in need, he concluded that workers should support each other. Employees of Aegis Living can contribute a portion of their paycheck to the Potato Soup Foundation, a charity Clark set up to help Aegis workers who have hit hard times. “If you can’t eat, we’ll feed you,” Clark told Seattle Business Magazine in 2013. “If someone needs emergency dental surgery and can’t afford it, we’ll pay for it.” Violet Lawler recalls the company often sharing a story about helping an employee who couldn’t afford to repair her broken-down car. “Why was she not being paid enough to get her car fixed?” Violet asks. “The general managers say this is a great thing that Dwayne Clark has done, but they never tell us how to apply for it,” says Anthony Ledesma, former lead housekeeper at Aegis Greenwood. “If someone came to me and asked me how to initiate it, I wouldn't have any way to point them to it.” Since 2007, tax returns show that Clark’s Potato Soup Foundation received over $1.3 million in donations. Although in interviews, Clark says the foundation is primarily funded by Aegis workers donating a percentage of their paychecks, the website claims it also receives funds “from outside organizations and donors.” Their tax returns don’t list any of these outside organizations or donors. They say that over $1 million in donations to the Potato Soup Foundation have been dispersed, but do not identify where these funds have gone. We are able to verify one public instance of an Aegis worker who received funds from the Potato Soup Foundation. In March 2021, a care worker named Nick Reyes from Aegis’ Dana Point, CA, location died from COVID-19. Dwayne Clark helped set up a GoFundMe page for the family and even wrote something urging others to donate. In the Potato Soup Foundation’s tax returns, they report that they brought in $20,000 from a fundraising event for the Reyes family. And, sure enough, on the public GoFundMe page, there is a donation from the Clark Family Legacy Foundation to help Reyes’ grieving family: but for only $10,000. Half of what they claimed they received in donations. The Line Workers Many current and former Aegis employees expressed concerns with the inconsistencies in the way Clark represents himself, but over and over again they said the most offensive claim was that he values his employees. Despite Aegis making nearly $250 million per year in annual revenue, very little trickles down to the “line workers” (as they’re called at Aegis) who directly interact with the senior citizens in Aegis’ self-described “luxury communities.” Although Clark claims they pay industry-standard rates or better, caregivers, kitchen workers, and housekeepers are hired at barely above minimum wage, typically no more than $20 per hour. One of Aegis’ main competitors, Horizon House, is a similarly luxury private-pay assisted living community. Their union contract with SEIU 775 starts workers with no experience at $24 per hour. A representative from SEIU 775 says that ⅓ of workers start higher than that. The living wage in King County is $30.82. In a Facebook post in 2022, Clark reflected on his rise to success from making just $6 per hour at age 16 working the “wheat fields and pea fields of Walla Walla.” According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, $6 in 1974 is worth over $40 today—two times as much as he pays his line workers. SEIU 775, the union who represents the workers at Aegis Ravenna, has been trying to negotiate a fair contract with Aegis for nearly two years now. Aegis is reportedly offering only pennies in compromise. According to someone familiar with the talks, the union is asking for more staffing and training to meet their elderly residents’ needs, as well as an additional $2-4 per hour for employees to match other competitive assisted living communities. Will Brattain, the former certified nursing assistant (CNA) at Aegis Ravenna from 2022 to 2024, says, “I was hired at $22 an hour and I was the highest-paid CNA in the building.” A former HR employee who worked at Aegis from 2021 to 2024 says if a candidate ever requested over $22 per hour, they had to get approval from their boss. “Rarely was it ever approved,” they say. “And in HR, you get what you pay for.” And it doesn’t appear to improve from there for the folks helping the residents. Violet Lawler says she started at Aegis in 2019 making $18 per hour as a life enrichment assistant, running activities for the residents. Over the years she was able to get marginal raises, but it wasn’t easy. “I was at $19 per hour when I learned that two male LEA’s (life enrichment assistants) with no prior experience had just been hired at $21 per hour. I called Aegis out on it and they bumped me up to the same rate,” she said. Eventually she made it up to $23 per hour. Then she hit a ceiling. Lawler says after working for Aegis for almost five years, including moving over to help them open their new Aegis Greenwood facility in 2022, and receiving positive performance reviews, at her annual performance meeting in January 2024 she was only offered a raise of 92 cents an hour. ”There was no explanation for why,” Lawler says. “And 92 cents is just insulting. It did not cover the cost-of-living increase. So when you look at it that way, you're almost making less money this year than you did last year.” Clark frequently claims employee turnover in the senior care sector is as high as 200%, and that at Aegis that figure is closer to 20 to 50 percent. Neither appear to be true. According to Seniorly, turnover for senior care facilities averaged 52.1% in 2024. As for that 20 to 50 percent turnover at Aegis claim? Workers tell a different story. “For sure, that’s an inaccurate statement,” said Anthony Ledesma to The Stranger in December 2024 when he was the lead housekeeper at Aegis Greenwood (he’s since left). “Especially with caregivers, the turnover rate is crazy. A lot of the caregivers that I knew when I started are gone now.” Anthony was hired only a year earlier, in December 2023. Violet Lawler says after helping open the Greenwood location in 2022, she estimates of her roughly 40 original co-workers across five departments, only two were still employed there two years later. The data seems to agree. During their contract bargaining, Aegis shared headcount data with SEIU 775, the union representing the workers at Aegis Ravenna. A report from January 2024 shows that in 2023, turnover at that location was 92.1%. A June 2024 report shows that turnover for that year was already at 56.1% only halfway through the year. Then, according to Megan Parke from SEIU 775, Aegis stopped responding to information requests. “A lot of people were leaving and taking jobs at Dick's or other fast food restaurants because they're more money, less stress, and less responsibility,” a former HR employee who left the company in 2024 says. Low pay isn’t all that’s driving workers away from Aegis. In a class-action lawsuit in 2018, over 10,000 former employees in Washington and California alleged, in part, that Aegis was violating elder financial abuse and consumer protection laws by deliberately understaffing their facilities. One worker also claimed they were paid $5.82 per hour when their contract was for $17 per hour. (The sanitized version that was reported in the press on sites like McKnight’s Senior Living claimed the suit merely alleged the company made “staffing decisions were based on budgets rather than resident care needs.”) “The core of our mission and culture is to provide the highest level of care for our residents. From the beginning, we have fervently disputed the allegations in this case,” Aegis Living General Counsel Elizabeth Chambers told McKnight’s Senior Living. “After several years of aggressively litigating, we made the decision to stop fighting, collaborate with the plaintiff’s attorneys, and put an end to this case so we can continue focusing our full attention on what matters most — our residents, their families and our team.” The company agreed to settle the lawsuit in 2021 by paying the plaintiffs $16.25 million. A complaint filed with the Seattle Office of Labor Standards (OLS) shows a pattern of wage discrepancy. A former employee at the Madison location from November 2021 to January 2022 alleged she was hired at a rate of $17.50 per hour but paid at the rate of $17.25 for months. She was also allegedly promised a typical morning-afternoon shift then after hiring, was instructed to work the opening shift starting at 5:30 am. At that time, the worker says, Aegis’ payroll system went down and she began receiving odd amounts of money through physical checks and direct deposits with no formal accounting of her hours or Paid Sick and Safe Time. When she requested the terms she originally agreed to, and for formal pay stubs, she says she was ignored. When she walked out, she was fired. A second complaint with the OLS in 2021 alleged that Aegis refused to pay a worker’s Paid Sick and Safe Time, and neglected on five separate occasions to pay him overtime rates on short notice. Both workers found employment elsewhere, and OLS referred them to Washington State Labor & Industries to file a claim. Understaffing is a widespread issue as well, according to workers. Gurnesh Chetty, a medical technician at Aegis Ravenna since April 2021, says, “We’re always understaffed. Then when staff asks management for help, the response we always get is, ‘We don’t have the budget to hire more staff.’ But they have the budget to open a new location every month.” “It's low pay,” Violet Lawler says. “Everybody is getting run into the ground. Everybody is just absolutely worked to the bone. We care so much about the job that we kind of put up with it for longer than we should. The burnout level is so incredibly high.” “Tired people make mistakes, and mistakes cause accidents. Those accidents can be life or death,” Will Brattain says. Fed up with these conditions, the staff at Aegis’ Ravenna location started organizing in late 2022. Once word got to corporate, instead of meeting with their workers to figure out solutions, the company went into protection mode. They’d already been fined $53,451 by the National Labor Relations Board for anti-worker surveillance and retaliation, but now—with the help of notorious union-busting firm Morgan Lewis—they ramped it up even further. In a closed-door meeting, those with direct knowledge say Clark gave executives specific marching orders: no union sympathizers. Jeri Leasure, former head of recruiting at Aegis, says that in the summer of 2022, “Dwayne had what he called a ‘fireside chat’ at the home office, where he invited all the GMs from all of his communities to come to the home office and lectured them about how they needed to scrub social media, they needed to scrub the resumes, they needed to make sure no one was affiliated with a union.” She says shortly after, she interviewed a cook for an open job at Aegis’ Lake Union location. Then, she says, she got a call from the regional culinary services director. “She goes, ‘Not only no, but hell no. He used to work at Lumen Field, and they’re all union,’” Jeri says she was told. SEIU 775 has filed 47 Unfair Labor Practice charges against Aegis with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging illegal surveillance and retaliation, among other charges. In one outrageous case, the general manager at Aegis Greenwood allegedly saw one of their workers speaking to SEIU representatives on her lunch break off of company grounds. So they fired her at the end of the day. Former colleagues allege that Dwayne J. Clark also perceived that this new union push was caused by college-educated workers infiltrating their workforce. So the solution, according to multiple former HR employees, was to reject candidates with college degrees or even just resumes that looked “too polished.” One HR employee says they were told their ideal candidate was “dumb enough, but good enough for the job.” In May 2024, when Aegis opened their new 48,000-square-foot Laurelhurst building across from the University of Washington, the company put on a job fair but recruiters were instructed to not hire any UW students. “‘We’re not going to hire anybody that’s going to UW or any colleges because they study unions,’” Jeri says she was told by her boss, the Vice President of Talent. “The recruiter running that job fair came up to me and she was like, ‘How the hell am I not going to hire any students?’” Jeri told the recruiter to go ask the new Vice President of Talent. “Make all the shifts 8-to-5, and they need to be available seven days a week,” she was told by the Vice President of Talent. “That’s how you will deter any student.” In the summer of 2024, workers at the corporate office raised concerns not only about these anti-union hiring practices, but also alleged discrimination in the workplace. After this new VP of Talent was hired that spring, positions that brought in hundreds of applicants only resulted in interviews for one profile of candidate: white women in their 20’s. Jeri said she felt her new boss was hiring younger recruiters around her to push her out. She is a single mother and her teenage son—who also worked at Aegis—was just in a life-threatening car accident. She desperately needed to keep her job. Jeri went to one of her other bosses to raise these concerns. “Listen, the discrimination has to stop,” Jeri says she told her boss. “It’s the union. It’s race. It’s age.” “No, no, no. I don’t think that’s what she’s doing,” Jeri says she was told by her boss. A week later, Aegis fired Jeri. Her son, too. The Trickle-Down Effect Most concerning is the effects these management practices are having on Aegis Living’s clients: vulnerable elderly people in need of protective care. “They are a profoundly corrupt organization,” says an Issaquah man named David Pollock whose mother and father lived at Aegis of Bellevue. “There isn’t just fire where there’s smoke. It’s a forest fire.” In 2014, Pollock and his family received an email from Aegis informing them that care for their elderly father needed to be ramped up from 8-10 hours per day to 24/7 care, with a hefty price increase to $6,000 per week. The family was concerned about the cost and wanted to make sure he was getting qualified help, so they asked if they could vet and hire outside help to come in and help their father. But after the company “very strongly objected,” the family reluctantly agreed to pay to ramp up his care at Aegis. But just to be sure, the Pollock family installed a camera in their father’s room. What Pollock reports he saw was appalling. When he would visit his father, “he would have a thick beard and was dressed in his same clothes day after day.” According to a lawsuit they later filed against Aegis, not only did the video footage show their father was not receiving the round-the-clock care they were now paying for, but he was being ignored while covered in his own urine and feces, kept awake by workers loudly talking and watching television in his room, and left alone without food or help getting outside for fresh air. He complained to two care team members as well as the general manager of the building. But Pollock says they were more worried about the camera in the room, which they confiscated and refused to return, than addressing his concerns about his father’s care. His father allegedly lost 24 pounds in January 2014 and another 15 in February before the family removed him from the Aegis facility. “He’s going to die today!” Pollock says one of the Aegis workers told him as they wheeled his elderly father out. “You need to take him to the hospital.” Pollock did take his father to the hospital, and after several weeks there he improved. In a chilling moment, Pollock says his father told him that he had no memory of his previous six months living at Aegis. The family then moved their father to a family care facility, a more intimate six-person complex that was 20 percent cheaper than Aegis, they say, and he lived there happily for almost another year until dying from an accidental slip and fall. When Pollock and his family sued Aegis, the company fought the lawsuit on the technicality that since Washington state is a two-direction recording state, meaning both parties must consent, the video was inadmissible in court. Aegis sent Pollock a letter that they would sue the Pollocks for any losses incurred in the lawsuit unless they dropped it. So the Pollocks did. But in that letter from Aegis, the company split a curious hair. They claimed they didn’t have any liability in the case at all because the workers identified in the complaint weren’t technically employees of Aegis, but third-party contractors. How could that be true? Pollock wondered. A former member of Aegis’ HR team confirms that as recently as 2024, many workers in Aegis buildings are actually provided by a third-party staffing agency. “The staffing agencies don't have to follow the same regulations that we do,” said a former HR employee in late 2024. “I had employees that were coming from the agency that didn't have work authorization, you know, green cards or papers.” What was their primary consideration when considering third-party contractors? I asked. They said simply: “Cost.” In that class-action lawsuit from 2018, a plaintiff claimed that their family member, a resident who was paying $6,235 a month at Aegis Bellevue, was also dangerously neglected during her time at Aegis. The lawsuit alleged that on numerous occasions, “Ms. Shanahan’s family members found her unattended on the floor tangled in her bedding. She had sustained numerous unattended falls at Aegis, resulting in lacerations and bruises throughout her body.” In 2022, a caregiver at Aegis Shoreline raped two elderly women with Alzheimer’s. (The suspect pled guilty in January.) Because the two victims suffer from Alzheimer’s and cognitive issues, their claims at first were not escalated by family and staff. Then, two days after the reports were finally sent to the state, one of the victims pointed at one of the workers in the hallway and identified him as the man who raped her. Lauren Ragen, a daughter of one of the victims, told KUOW last year, ""I can only imagine how many situations like this have occurred that were swept under the rug, because the victim's experience wasn't a trusted source. So much has been taken from them already. We must take care of them."" In support of SB 5337, a new law establishing certification standards for memory care providers, 9 people testified to their experience with Aegis. “My dad’s time at Aegis Living and Life Care of Kirkland was a nightmare,” said Ginger Jackson of Issaquah. “He needed help with transfers, but at Aegis he didn't have a functioning call button.They kept saying they would fix it, or that they had already fixed it, but they hadn't. Understaffing is a huge issue. The care staff aren’t given the resources to do their jobs properly, they are stretched too thin, overworked and underpaid. Some of the most vulnerable people in our communities are in assisted living facilities. They need and deserve to be safe and cared for.” Jennifer Furch of Woodinville said, “The staffing ratio at Aegis Marymoor was inadequate, leaving residents without the attention and support they needed. Care staff, overburdened and undertrained, were unable to consistently deliver the services outlined in residents' care plans. Documentation of care was alarmingly absent, relying solely on verbal communication at shift change, which led to errors and lapses in care. Most troubling, staff were not trained to effectively communicate with residents who have dementia, leaving vulnerable individuals like my mother without the understanding and dignity they deserve.” Since September 2021, Aegis Living facilities have been reported to the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services 333 times, resulting in eight different fines for violations including not administering medications on time and potentially exposing residents to life-threatening diseases. In the past three years alone, residents and their families have filed 94 complaints to the Washington State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program, a federal organization that advocates for residents in assisted living facilities. Some of the complaints alleged “abuse, gross neglect, and exploitation.” Patricia Hunter, the Washington State Ombuds since 2011, says in the long-term care industry, the number of complaints against Aegis aren’t that far out of the norm. But for a luxury facility, they’re surprising. “I think the expectations [of residents at Aegis] are really high. But at that cost, why wouldn’t they be?” she says. Considering the huge price tag of Aegis facilities alongside these allegations of low pay, understaffing, and substandard care, Hunter says, “It sounds like a grift.” But none of these issues seem to be affecting Aegis’ bottom line. They’re preparing to break ground on two new senior housing facilities in Woodinville and Sammamish. And the accolades keep rolling in. One might wonder how Aegis Greenwood, home of the 92-cent raise, was recently named the best senior living facility in the country by Seniorly. It appears to be a byproduct of silence. Their website says, “To qualify for the Awards, communities must be in the top five percent of our consumer sentiment ratings, be free of serious licensing violations for the last 36 months and have no evidence of negative media coverage for the last 24 months.” That’s not all: McKnight’s Senior Living just named Clark their Pinnacle Awards Career Achievement Award winner for 2025. “Dwayne Clark generously shares the thinking behind his bold moves with others to move the sector forward, but he also leads by example — and what an example,” McKnight’s Editorial Director, Vice President, and Associate Publisher John O’Connor said in the announcement. The award-winner recently outlined his 2025 plans for Aegis for Senior Housing News. In his interview, he said he’s looking into artificial intelligence and offshoring jobs to reduce some of Aegis’ operations costs. “It’s funny to me, the way [Clark] describes his upbringing, the way that he describes his grandmother. His grandmother would not have been able to afford to live at Aegis,” says Will Brattain. Would she even want to? Would you? “As someone that's worked in that industry, I worry about what will happen when I get too old to take care of myself,” Will says. “I've worked at a nursing home, I've worked at Aegis assisted living, I've worked in independent care…and I can safely say that I would never put my aging relatives in Aegis Living.”",,"['candidate', 'lewis', 'budget', 'housing', 'police', 'labor', 'union', 'workers', 'organizing']",20.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.338925,32745

Council President Ashley Martin stood nervously at the front of the crowded room at Grace United Methodist Church, wringing a copy of the council’s newsletter, The Leschi News, in her hands. “So to address the elephant in the room…” Martin began, explaining that this was originally planned as a neighborhood Q&A with Seattle Police Department Chief Shon Barnes. “This was also posted as this is a forum to discuss the situation, I’m not even going to try and describe the right word for it, at Denny Blaine Park.” Martin decided the first half of the meeting would stick to the original agenda and the second half would be devoted to the “situation.” Just who was here to ask Barnes about the “situation” was visually obvious. The people with the signs and colorful hair wanted to know: Why did three of his officers make a bunch of legally nude people put their clothes on at a queer nude beach on Sunday and kicked out a trans woman who refused to get dressed? But first, a brief (roughly twenty-minute) introduction. After discussing his history as a teacher turned cop, his wife, who’s a doctor, and three kids still back in the midwest, and his lonely home life in Seattle without them, Barnes took questions. He had just started answering one about the Before the Badge training program when Chavisa Woods, who lives in Leschi and has gone to Denny Blaine with her partner for 12 years, lost patience. “Half of us are here to talk about Denny Blaine, and you said we’d get time for that,” Woods says. “You told us about your college major before you got to Denny Blaine,” someone says. “You said we would get to Denny Blaine first.” “No no,” President Martin says, now seated at a table at the front of the room. “I said we were going to get to the original intent of the meeting first.” “Respectfully,” Woods says over the babble. “They are cracking down on queer bodies and raiding queer spaces,” Woods says. After about twenty more minutes of questions, Woods was called on. “We sat here politely and listened to you talk about how great the police are, but a lot of us have never had that experience,” Woods says. “I would like to know why it’s okay for the police to come to queer spaces and start cracking down on people for public nudity, which is not even illegal in the city of Seattle.” “Is nudity illegal?” says a man at the back with long grey hair. “That’s the first question.” “No,” people groan and yell at him. Barnes finally pipes up. “So being nude is free expression, not illegal,” he says. “Not illegal. Let me explain to you what happened.” Barnes explained that the officers were receiving complaints about nudity and masturbation, which Barnes (hilariously) called “activity that may shock the conscience.” The officers had been instructed to patrol the park in search of said shocking acts, Barnes says, but “mistakenly they were wrong” when they asked people to put their clothes on. Barnes was explaining that the trans woman was issued a code of conduct violation and told not to come back to the beach for a week when that woman, standing in the back of the room, interrupted him. “It was a business card!” she says. “That’s what they gave me.” “And to correct you,” says Colleen Kimseylove, co-leader of the park stewardship group Friends of Denny Blaine. “The officer trespassed the woman for being naked. We have photo evidence, she’s laying down, she’s doing nothing.” “It is my understanding that that will be rescinded, alright,” Barnes says. “Am I allowed at the park or not?” says the woman in the back. “Yes,” Barnes says. People clapped. Later, someone in the crowd asked him to say sorry. “I did that.” “I was detained!” the woman says. “That’s not a thing that you apologized for.” “That’s something you get sued for,” someone quips. “Well, we don’t comment on pending lawsuits,” Barnes says. (It’s unclear if there is a pending suit, or if Barnes was saying he couldn’t comment on the prospect of being sued. SPD told The Stranger they're unaware of any pending lawsuits.) At the end of the meeting, Barnes apologized to anyone who “may have been offended” by his officers misinterpreting the law. “We’re not perfect,” he says. Sunday’s “mistake” came shortly after a neighbors group, Denny Blaine Park for All, sued the city for allegedly allowing the beach to turn into a den of cum and villainy where public sex and masturbation were supposedly commonplace. Masturbation surely happens at Denny Blaine as it does at our city’s many beautiful parks, as well as on our buses and street corners, but the more than 50 beachgoers who’ve spoken to The Stranger about Denny Blaine in the last year and half say the neighbors’ characterization is overblown. Masturbation is anathema at Denny Blaine, and beachgoers kick people out when they see it. Kimseylove, who is holding an intervention training at the beach on May 18, says they suspect neighbors are reporting masturbation in places like the parking lot where beachgoers aren’t even aware it’s happening. But the suit isn’t just going after illegal public masturbation, it alleges that legal nudity violates the Parks Department’s code of conduct because it’s depriving them enjoyment of the beach. The beachgoers just see it as the latest scheme to kick them out. Before the suit, an anonymous donor (later unmasked by the millionaire owner of University Village and next door neighbor to Denny Blaine Park Stuart Sloan, also part of the group that filed the suit) hatched a $1 million plan to build a children’s playground at the beach. Before that plan went public in the fall 2023, Sloan vented his frustrations about nudity in text messages to Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell’s private cell phone. He sent the Mayor photos of naked people on the beach, which he called “DISGUSTING.” Harrell promised Sloan that deputy Mayor (now SDOT Director) Adiam Emery would help him. Emery and Seattle Parks Department employees met with Sloan for months, even reviewing plans for the park. After a lively and loud public meeting in December 2023, where dozens said the beach was a place of freedom and safety, Parks cancelled the playground. Public records show Harrell met with Sloan twice, including the day after the city announced the plan was dead, but maintained he never knew the donor’s identity. In the first few months of 2024, beachgoers and neighbors tried to hash out a solution to end the conflict for good, but nothing really came of the talks. Lately though, the city has paid Denny Blaine extra attention. As The Stranger reported Monday, in March, Seattle Park Rangers told a nude sunbather to either get dressed or move closer to the water where he couldn’t be seen from the street. In April, police showed up at least two times as part of the patrols Barnes mentioned last night. Blake Waddell, a beach regular there both times, says one officer told him higher ups were directing the patrols. A sergeant told Kimseylove the same thing at the beach Sunday. (In all these cases, no lewd behavior was found). Waddell, who was also at the beach Sunday, says he filed a complaint with a sergeant on the spot. In an email, Harrell’s office denied directing SPD to change its approach at Denny Blaine. The Seattle Parks Department says Park Rangers have routinely stopped by Denny Blaine since March 2024 and that there’s been no change to policy. According to the lawsuit, neighbors met with City Councilmember Joy Hollingsworth three times last year. Two months ago, after Hollingsworth talked about the meetings on the podcast Seattle Nice, she told The Stranger neighbors had asked park rangers to look out for masturbation, but that there was no plan for that. Hollingsworth told The Stranger by text Monday night that she had no comment on the Sunday incident, but then posted to X that she and her staff were monitoring the “situation” and were in active communication with SPD, the Parks Department, and the Mayor’s Office about what happened. Barnes says he’s working with Hollingsworth to set up meetings between SPD and the city’s queer community. Hollingsworth also recently met with Friends of Denny Blaine. “My ongoing hope—and priority—is that we can collaboratively develop a solution that respects the park’s unique heritage while ensuring the safety, dignity, and well-being of everyone who visits,” Hollingsworth wrote. At last night’s meeting, Barnes said the “directed patrols” at Denny Blaine would end and that he’d bring in Park Rangers to figure out when it was appropriate to call the cops. Though, when The Stranger asked Parks about the rangers who told a man to put on his clothes, Parks said police would take the lead on complaints of lewd behavior from then on. One woman at the meeting said the cops hadn’t been of much help to beachgoers so far. She said beachgoers used to regularly call about a “predator” harassing women at the beach. When the cops came, they’d allegedly tell the women the man was harassing to put their clothes on. That man eventually pushed someone down the stairs, nearly killing them, she says. Barnes said he wanted to follow up on that. A man with a coif of dark hair named Michael asked Barnes if his officers would now know nudity was legal in the park and would “never again harass someone for simply being in the buff.” “I will make sure that everyone understands that nudity is legal,” Barnes says. “But I will not, I could not commit to saying never about anything. I don’t know why they may be there. They may be there for something totally unrelated and it gets attributed to that.” “That’s, that’s not the question,” someone says. “Well, then that’s the answer,” Barnes says. “Next question.” When a woman asked what she should do the next time a police officer told her to get dressed at Denny Blaine, Barnes said she could remind them nudity is “free expression” in the city of Seattle, the exact thing beachgoers did Sunday. “Can we say that you told us it was okay?” she asked. If he answered, laughter and applause drowned it out. “We are committed to working with you,” Barnes says, after shooting down Kimseylove’s request for another half hour of questions. “I don’t want anyone to walk out of here, number one, thinking you have a police department that doesn’t support who you are … Lastly, let me say this, this conversation is not over.” Kimseylove wasn’t thrilled with Barnes. “I think that was a show of nonsense,” Kimseylove says, frustrated that Barnes did not make more time for questions and left open the ambiguous possibility of future enforcement. “If there is an incident, you are the one with the data, the resources, the money, the information to figure out a way to make sure it doesn’t happen again. The only variable we are asking you to control, Seattle Police Department, is your own employees.” That much he could have committed to, Kimseylove says. Four others who spoke with The Stranger weren’t confident this was truly over either. It wasn’t the meeting the Leschi Community Council thought it would be. Council President Ashley Martin stood nervously at the front of the crowded room at Grace United Methodist Church, wringing a copy of the council’s newsletter, The Leschi News, in her hands. “So to address the elephant in the room…” Martin began, explaining that this was originally planned as a neighborhood Q&A with Seattle Police Department Chief Shon Barnes. “This was also posted as this is a forum to discuss the situation, I’m not even going to try and describe the right word for it, at Denny Blaine Park.” Martin decided the first half of the meeting would stick to the original agenda and the second half would be devoted to the “situation.” Just who was here to ask Barnes about the “situation” was visually obvious.

Hollingsworth told The Stranger by text Monday night that she had no comment on the Sunday incident, but then posted to X that she and her staff were monitoring the “situation” and were in active communication with SPD, the Parks Department, and the Mayor’s Office about what happened. Barnes says he’s working with Hollingsworth to set up meetings between SPD and the city’s queer community. Hollingsworth also recently met with Friends of Denny Blaine. “My ongoing hope—and priority—is that we can collaboratively develop a solution that respects the park’s unique heritage while ensuring the safety, dignity, and well-being of everyone who visits,” Hollingsworth wrote. At last night’s meeting, Barnes said the “directed patrols” at Denny Blaine would end and that he’d bring in Park Rangers to figure out when it was appropriate to call the cops. Though, when The Stranger asked Parks about the rangers who told a man to put on his clothes, Parks said police would take the lead on complaints of lewd behavior from then on. One woman at the meeting said the cops hadn’t been of much help to beachgoers so far. She said beachgoers used to regularly call about a “predator” harassing women at the beach. When the cops came, they’d allegedly tell the women the man was harassing to put their clothes on. That man eventually pushed someone down the stairs, nearly killing them, she says. Barnes said he wanted to follow up on that. A man with a coif of dark hair named Michael asked Barnes if his officers would now know nudity was legal in the park and would “never again harass someone for simply being in the buff.” “I will make sure that everyone understands that nudity is legal,” Barnes says. “But I will not, I could not commit to saying never about anything. I don’t know why they may be there. They may be there for something totally unrelated and it gets attributed to that.” “That’s, that’s not the question,” someone says. “Well, then that’s the answer,” Barnes says. “Next question.” When a woman asked what she should do the next time a police officer told her to get dressed at Denny Blaine, Barnes said she could remind them nudity is “free expression” in the city of Seattle, the exact thing beachgoers did Sunday. “Can we say that you told us it was okay?” she asked. If he answered, laughter and applause drowned it out. “We are committed to working with you,” Barnes says, after shooting down Kimseylove’s request for another half hour of questions. “I don’t want anyone to walk out of here, number one, thinking you have a police department that doesn’t support who you are … Lastly, let me say this, this conversation is not over.” Kimseylove wasn’t thrilled with Barnes. “I think that was a show of nonsense,” Kimseylove says, frustrated that Barnes did not make more time for questions and left open the ambiguous possibility of future enforcement. “If there is an incident, you are the one with the data, the resources, the money, the information to figure out a way to make sure it doesn’t happen again. The only variable we are asking you to control, Seattle Police Department, is your own employees.” That much he could have committed to, Kimseylove says. Four others who spoke with The Stranger weren’t confident this was truly over either.",,"['mayor', 'councilmember', 'harrell', 'bruce harrell', 'police', 'SPD', 'policy', 'parks', 'SPD (title)']",19.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.316458,22027

In exchange for Dave admitting to the citation, agreeing to pay a $5,000 fine, and attending driving school, the Seattle City Attorney’s Office (CAO) asked the court to waive a 90-day license suspension for Dave. The killing of Kandula garnered international headlines after the body-cam video of Seattle Police Officer and police union Vice President Daniel Auderer cackling at her death became public. The Seattle Police Department has since fired Auderer, and Dave’s discipline for his involvement in Kandula’s death is pending. Auderer has since filed a $20 million lawsuit against the city. At Wednesday’s hearing, Seattle Municipal Court (SMC) Judge Noah Weil accepted the negotiated settlement between the City and Dave, but added a condition for Dave to complete 40 hours of community service. The penalty guidelines for negligent driving allow for a judge to require up to 100 hours of community service, but Weil noted that as a law enforcement officer Dave “does contribute to the community.” “But I do want to recognize the impact this offense has had on the community as well, and so I’m going to require 40 hours of community service,” Weil said. Dave has 30 days to pay his $5,000 fine and about nine months to fulfill the court-ordered conditions of his sentence. Under the agreement with prosecutors, he can avoid a license suspension as long as he commits no new criminal traffic offenses over the next year and complies with all his other sentencing conditions. Dave’s attorney did not immediately return a request for comment. CAO spokesperson Tim Robinson pointed The Stranger to the court records and said the CAO's office handled Dave's case like any other charge of negligent driving in the second degree with a vulnerable person. Robinson is correct that similar charges often result in no license suspension and, in some cases, the CAO may dismiss the ticket, even when a pedestrian’s death is involved. However, Dave’s position as a police officer shielded him from facing more serious charges, as state law permits officers to exceed the speed limit while responding to emergency calls. Earlier this year, the King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office (KCPAO) declined to charge Dave with a felony vehicular homicide in the death of Kandula. Their investigation determined that on January 23, 2023, Dave hit Kandula while traveling at about 63 miles per hour as she crossed in a crosswalk at the intersection of Dexter Avenue North and Thomas Street in South Lake Union. Seconds before Dave saw her crossing, he hit speeds of up to 74 miles per hour in a 25-mile-per-hour zone. Dave attempted to break a second before hitting her. Investigators concluded that had Dave traveled at speeds closer to 50 miles per hour, he could have avoided hitting Kandula. After hitting her, Dave began CPR. The KCPAO found they could not charge Dave as they could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he “consciously” drove with “reckless disregard for the safety of others.” After the KCPAO declined to prosecute, they bounced the case back to the Seattle Police Department, who referred the case to the CAO’s office as a citation. With Dave’s court penalties basically wrapped up, he still awaits a disciplinary decision from SPD connected to the killing of Kandula. In early November, the Office of Police Accountability concluded its investigation into Dave, finding he violated SPD’s policies around driving and not breaking the law, but Interim Chief of Police Sue Rahr has yet to decide on final discipline for Dave. Since Kandula’s death, Publicola has uncovered extensive examples of Dave’s poor driving history and a previous firing from another police department, all of which SPD knew prior to hiring him.",,"['municipal', 'davison', 'ann davison', 'police', 'SPD', 'union', 'davison (title)', 'ann davison (title)', 'SPD (title)']",19.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.328750,3910
https://www.thestranger.com/podcasts/2025/08/01/80175502/francesca-fiorentini-says-grab-a-spine-and-laugh,The Stranger (Web),Francesca Fiorentini Says Grab a Spine (and Laugh) Just Can't Get Enough?,"Francesca Fiorentini has a blunt prescription for what she sees as a left stuck in an endless loop of existential psychoanalysis, that's agonizing over its ailments, fumbling for its spine, and waiting for a savior: “We need fewer podcasters and more revolutionaries and organizers.” It might seem richly ironic coming from a podcaster–-okay, technically the comedian, intrepid journalist, social justice shit-stirrer, online influencer, who podcasts. Saying what needs to be said, what others are afraid to say, is exactly her brand and the point of The Bitchuation Room. The Los Angeles-based Fiorentini calls Gaza’s genocide a genocide and urges her audience to do the same, roasts popular progressive podcasts like MeidasTouch for ghosting the topic entirely, lambests the human embodiment of the Daily Mail comment section, Piers Morgan, to his face for his hypocrisy, and challenges the left to not just repeat what’s popular but “to make popular what we need said.” It’s that fearlessness that has given her Fran-tifa faithful (as she calls her fanbase) the rare, iconoclastic mix of wit, rage, and clarity nearly extinct from political comedy podcasts. The manospheric Theo Von has to break out a dictionary just to define the word “convene.” In addition to her work with Al Jazeera, Fiorentini rose to popularity as a contributor on the long-running, once-progressive internet news show The Young Turks (TYT). After nearly a decade of keeping it relevant, she walked away in March 2025 when it started flirting with “bridge-building” with MAGA. True to form, she called out what she saw as capitulations to conservatism, saying TYT founder Cenk Uygur was, “acting like a bitch.” Uygur responded with a self-indulgent half‑hour video explaining why he was “removing” her from the network. Fiorentini has happily moved on. Her fans stayed loyal to her. Not only for her politics, but her defiant, necessary gallows humor that helps wring a few ounces of joy from weeks when the news cycle itself feels like the best case against humanity. She’s not the left’s Joe Rogan (she has 250k subscribers to his 20 million) and won’t be. She’s unwilling to cuddle up to the powerful or compromise with fascists. I don’t believe in role models, yet she manages to be mine, and one to so many others. With headlines feeling like a daily descent into the abyss, Fiorentini has been a steady reminder that though these times may be grim, we don’t face them alone. And although the left may not need more podcasters, it sure as hell needs more Francesca Fiorentinis: voices willing to cut through the noise with courage, clarity, and an unshakable refusal to surrender integrity. You can catch the one and only this Saturday at the Rainier Arts Center in Columbia City, where she’ll be taping a live episode of The Bitchuation Room alongside Ijeoma Oluo, mayoral candidate Katie Wilson, and comedian Derek Sheen. She spoke to The Stranger about why the left needs to loosen up, the fragile idiocy of billionaires, the crackdown on adversarial media, and what it would take to finally build a progressive media ecosystem that’s both sustainable and fearless. [This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.] What made you hop up I-5 and bring your show to Seattle from LA? You’ve got a strong following, but why here? Obviously, I’m here to reboot CHAZ—sorry, CHOP. I’m calling it Frantifa, which is what I call my followers: radicals who also like to laugh. Seattle’s always had a reputation for culture and politics, so it made sense. And honestly, if we’re gonna survive fascism, we need a front that’s politically sharp and culturally fun, inclusive, and inviting. We’ve sold out shows in Chicago, Brooklyn, San Francisco, Portland—Seattle was overdue for some love. I love grounding the show in the city we’re in, which means pulling in local activists, artists, comedians, even elected officials. That’s why I’m thrilled mayoral candidate Katie Wilson is joining us. In Chicago we had Rosana Rodriguez, a DSA-backed alderwoman. In Brooklyn, Tiffany Cabán. In L.A., we featured Eunisses Hernandez, an organizer turned councilmember. It’s about bringing all these threads together: politics, culture, comedy, and real strategies for surviving all the shit we’re up against. On your show you’ve called out even “progressive” outlets for neutering their politics or chasing clicks. Sometimes, as you’ve noted, Joe Rogan says more about Palestine than so-called progressive media. Where does The Bitchuation Room fit into this mess? Look, I don’t want to be the Rogan of the left. Gross. Joe Rogan is a bona fide idiot. But it’s true: a lot of media left of center is either watering down its politics or chasing clicks that end up fueling the right. I want The Bitchuation Room to be neither. I want the comedy and political analysis to be radical, unsafe—in a good way—and intersectional. Not “edgy” as in punching down or dropping slurs. Edgy as in: “abolish ICE.” “Defund the police.” “Free Palestine.” I’m tired of just reacting to Rogan, Andrew Schulz, Theo Von—whoever the right anoints this week. We need to build our own narratives. Calls to defund the police or reinvest in communities scared the establishment because they worked. Abolishing ICE is a real, winnable demand. These are headlines we should own, not let the right dictate. You were pioneering in the “new media” space years ago—doing podcasts, video, comedy, activism. But looking at the current landscape, with layoffs, streaming chaos, and the Colbert show gone—do you ever feel like the weary millennial auntie watching Gen Z hustle on TikTok? Oh, totally. The media industry right now is a dumpster fire. Private equity eats up outlets, merges them, lays everyone off. Streaming guts traditional networks. And suddenly, Colbert and 200 staffers are out of work. What happens? He’ll get a podcast. Great—I have a podcast too. But we’re all fighting for scraps in the same attention economy. Honestly, we need fewer podcasters and more revolutionaries. That’s what I try to do with The Bitchuation Room: platform actual movement leaders while keeping it funny. Because if media alone could save us, we’d be saved by now. Meanwhile, creators are handing over their content for free while Meta trains AI on it. At some point, we’re going to need a content strike—creators banding together for fair pay. With all that, what keeps you doing this work? You’ve got a two-year-old now. Life could be easier. I want the left to have a sense of humor again. To stop taking itself so damn seriously. We need spaces where we can talk about abolition, talk strategy, and still laugh. The right’s got comedians fawning over Trump and then turning on him when it’s convenient. Let them wallow. We need to build our own culture, our own joy. And it’s not just about jokes. Comedy that punches up can reveal truths the powerful want buried. That keeps me going. So does seeing new creators pop up—it gives me hope. And the truth is, the show is therapy for me. I can start an episode feeling like dog shit and finish it feeling a little less like dog shit. That community, even online, matters. You always sound grounded on the mic—even when the news is hellish. How do you stay sane enough to do it? Oh, I don’t. The news crushes me daily. But the show helps. It’s my therapy. I try to add something—an interview, a joke, a new angle—so it’s not just more doomscrolling. And I want to model irreverence. We can cry, rage, and still mock the Astronomer CEO and his HR girlfriend. We contain multitudes. Politically, that’s when we win too, when we stop pretending we have to be just one thing. What gives you hope that we can actually course correct as a society? Hope’s a stretch some days. I’m not as optimistic as I was at 18, protesting the Iraq War while it happened anyway. But I believe we don’t have to live like this. The billionaires running our lives? Fragile idiots. What we’re up against isn’t human nature—it’s structures, corruption, money. And structures can fall. The uprisings for Black Lives Matter and Palestine are signs of what’s possible. The powerful know it—that’s why they’re terrified. We just have to get Democrats out of the way long enough to fight. Some days, I fantasize about moving to Costa Rica. But I don’t want to look like I gave up. So I stay and fight. The Bitchuation Room LIVE will take place at the Rainier Arts Center at 8 pm (doors open at 7:30 pm) on Saturday, August 2nd. Tickets can be purchased here.",,"['mayoral', 'councilmember', 'candidate', 'wilson', 'katie wilson', 'police', 'activism']",19.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.302089,8513

I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says ‘I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;’ who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ‘more convenient season.’ Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection."" -Martin Luther King, “Letter from A Birmingham Jail,” 1963 I’m going to be honest: I’ve always been skeptical about the term ""Black Lives Matter."" Not the intention behind it, but the phrasing. With all due respect to Alicia Garza and Patrisse Cullors, the Black women who gave birth to this term, it has always felt like a rallying cry of “Water is Wet!” or “The Stove is Hot!” or even “Make America Pay Reparations!”—oh wait. “Of course my fucking life matters,” I’ve always thought. No matter what outside forces try to convince the masses, melanin is magic, majestic, ordinary, and ornery. I don’t subscribe to the idea that Black lives are less valuable. We matter. I know it. But for over a decade, this phrase has served as the go-to banner for a movement pushing for our lives to exist fully, without threats, barriers, and degradation. It’s with this knowledge I must acknowledge that every movement transforms, after all. From “I Am a Man” to “Black Lives Matter.” From “In God We Trust” to “Make America Great Again.” On June 5, 2020, the city of Washington, DC, commissioned a mural stretching two city blocks with the simple phrase “BLACK LIVES MATTER” in bold yellow letters. This street painting, located just three minutes from the White House, emerged amid the national outrage sparked by George Floyd’s brutal murder by police less than two weeks earlier. The streets were on fire—some precincts literally were. The pandemic had just forced millions to witness the horror of a man being killed while his brothers in blue stood by. The dots were starting to connect for some: Maybe this wasn’t just a series of isolated incidents. Maybe this was part of a much larger problem. The mural, which became known as Black Lives Matter Plaza, was symbolic. And contrary to the sentiments of some, symbolic gestures do indeed matter. For example, a swastika tells me a lot about a place or person in a very short amount of time. Coincidentally, so do American flags—but that’s another conversation. That line might offend my political connects. But I digress. Black Lives Matter Plaza became a form of protest, but also validation. And while “Black Lives Matter” isn’t my preferred rallying cry, I have to admit it felt good to see it carved out in the concrete. Key word: “felt”—past tense. At the time of writing this, the Trump administration and his allies in Congress began dismantling the mural. The process of destroying it is expected to take between six and eight weeks. They say the mural will be replaced with “more inclusive” works. Republicans are even working on renaming the area, “Liberty Plaza.” Symbols matter. 2020 marked a time when some began reevaluating the symbols that color, and in many ways direct, our lives. Some learned that the Confederacy wasn’t the only entity responsible for enslaving people; presidents of the Union were too. Some learned that slavery wasn’t just a moral issue—it was deeply economic, the backbone of this nation’s growth. Some learned that modern police departments in America evolved from “slave patrols,” whose primary task was capturing runaway enslaved people, who were considered above all, property. As the layers of history were peeled back, many of the symbols around us began to look more like scars than stars. And so the monuments started to fall. Hundreds of statues were dethroned, not by a vote, but by wrath. In my hometown of Portland, Oregon, symbols came tumbling down faster than shit in the Willamette River on a rainy day in the 90’s. George Washington fell. Thomas Jefferson was toppled in front of the once majority Black high school named after him. The 19th century co-owner and publisher of The Oregonian, Harvey Scott, felt the weight of gravity too; replaced by a bronze bust of York—the Black man who helped lead the Oregon Trail alongside Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, only to be returned to slavery at the end of the expedition. (York’s bust was later toppled too.) Grappling with this growing phenomenon of fallen statues, I wrote an article for Street Roots around this time titled “Racist Slurs Permeate Oregon Geography,” in which I detailed how an alarming number of rivers, streams, mountains, and more across my state were originally named after anti-Black slurs like Nigger Ben Mountain and Nigger Brown Canyon – some of which have been renamed since. The point was clear: in order to topple racism, we must do so at both the head and root, for it is in fact embedded throughout the soil of this stolen land. George Floyd, like Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and so many others, are now symbols—a stand-in for any Black life. We understood that what happened to them could happen to any of us at any time in this country. Because it does all the time. Sudden death. Slow death. The system loves to kill, and then throw up a shrine to your murderers. The Burnside Bridge in Portland is one of the many connecting points across the Willamette River, helping the city earn its nickname “Bridgetown.” Named after a white businessman active during the late 1800s, the drawbridge is one of a dozen that have been built across the river since the city was established some 17 decades ago. The bridge is one of the most accessible, whether by bus, car, bike, or foot. It connects the Eastside to downtown Portland, with the iconic Portland sign—featuring a flying deer whose nose glows red at Christmas—marking the entrance. There’s a story about the Ku Klux Klan’s involvement in the bridge’s construction. I don’t have enough ink space for that tangent right now—but do your Googles if you're curious. For me though, the Burnside Bridge had always been little more than a channel from point A to point B. But on June 2, 2020, it became the center of the universe. On that day, thousands of people gathered on the bridge. Estimates say more than 10,000 souls flooded the Burnside. I never watched the video of George Floyd’s final moments. I’d seen enough clips of state violence to know the horror, and I didn’t feel the need to bear witness to his murder either. While I’ve grown tired of these videos, I understand that the social media era I grew up in helped birth the Black Lives Matter movement and other adjacent organizing in my generation. Videos of the dark sides of our lives can go viral at any time, and now oftentimes do. But this time was particularly extraordinary. It was 17-year-old Darnella Frazier’s recording of George Floyd’s murder that gave the world a front row seat to his particularly cruel last moments. It was the existence of her video of his execution, paired with the hollowness of a pandemic that propelled so many millions around the globe to say his name; and thus ours. But for me, I did not need to see to know. I watched the livestream as 10,000 souls stood silently, face down with hands behind their backs for 9 minutes—the exact length of time Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into George Floyd’s neck. And for a moment, watching this scene, I thought maybe, just maybe, a change might come. I was living in an apartment in Old Town at the time, just blocks from where the scene was unfurling. I didn’t feel compelled to add my body to the mass that day. Not for any one reason, but for that moment, I felt like I was right there. I was proud. Dare I say, I was starting to feel some hope. The protests that followed George Floyd’s death were the largest in U.S. history. They weren’t confined to cities—they spread to suburbs, rural areas, and eventually to the world. From Portland to Poland, people joined the movement for Black lives, creating millions of new co-conspirators from all backgrounds. For a while, I wondered if the world was finally catching up to the way we’ve been catching hell. Could it be that America was beginning to “get it”? But 100+ days later, the protests gave way to distraction. Infighting, fatigue, and the usual tactics used by three letter agencies to dismantle Black liberation movements began to crystallize their grip. My pessimism was reignited. It’s not that the protests didn’t accomplish anything—they did. To suggest otherwise gives over-inflated credit to white mediocrity. We marched and learned. We shared stories and space. We cried, we gave. We pushed back. We reclaimed shit that’s been ours. That perfect storm, we rode it ‘til the wheels fell off. It’s 2025 now, and the storm has indeed passed. But the reality hasn’t. When would another moment like this come again? One where a viral pandemic sat the entire world down for months to show us our collective frailty? One where that same pandemic is paired with the death of a Black man in such a horrific way, that it compels millions to risk their health and very bodies in the midst of a global emergency, because finally we collectively understood that the emergency for Black people had been viral long before COVID-19. It won’t. It won’t ever happen again. IT WON’T! However, Black people will continue to die. In the five years since George Floyd, many more have, whether directly at the hands of the state or more covertly through systemic forces. Despite this, Black resistance persists. From Pan-Africans to the Panthers, the Urban League to the NAACP, seasoned activists to the next baton-carriers birthed out this leg of the Black Lives Matter movement; resistance remains varied but persistent. I too, persist. I wake up every day and do what I do; I protest. I write. I organize. I make art. I connect. I strategize. I tell the stories of our greatness. I raise two little girls to be conscious of the world they’re coming up in, giving them the a little bit more truth with every milestone, so that they do in fact understand that water is wet, the stove is hot, and that America should pay reparations. But I cannot yet tell them what world they will inherit. One of the most striking quotes from Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is, “the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice.” I first heard these words, revived by Rev. Dr. Leroy Haynes Jr., while covering a rally against police violence across the street from Portland City Hall as a reporter more than a decade ago. They always stuck with me. The older I get now though— especially since 2020—I fear those words were just pretty prose. The words King subsequently spoke towards the closing chapter of his life resonate more strongly these days: “I fear I may have integrated my people into a burning house.” Quote that at your next MLK Day get-together. As the common symbol of the Civil Rights movement and the de-facto figurehead for American progress, King’s words now feel more relevant than ever. Liberals love to blame Trump and the Republicans for the flames, but there are plenty on the other “side” who have forgotten the Burnside Bridge. There are many who have since seen the Burnside Bridge in 2020 and decided it would make for good art, a nice social media post, and “powerful” conversation, but continuous action was a step or two too far today. For many it seems George Floyd’s face is more like a Nirvana t-shirt today. The system is flawed, but not that bad. That’s the problem with symbols. Symbols should inspire, but they shouldn’t and can never replace action. The erasure of Black Lives Matter Plaza in D.C. doesn’t stop the work I do, but it is a reminder of the times we’re in. It's a reminder of how quickly some have sprinted from 2020, into “moderation.” A reminder that like unapologetically progressive (and absurdly accomplished) Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty’s replacement by law-and-order conservative Rene Gonzalez (who was mostly absurd) on Portland City Council; Just like Oregon Democrats and Republicans teaming up to roll back Measure 110 and recriminalize addiction; Just like Intisar Abioto raising a million dollars to reclaim the house of the Portland NAACP founder only to be undercut by a White Realtor and White buyers, And like the 2020 protests being reduced into “discourse” of “riots” that we must “clean up” after—America is back to its regularly scheduled programming. And the fire is burning. Five years later, George Floyd is no longer just a man. He’s a symbol—a reminder of America’s blood on the roots, and the leaves. I know what I see when I see George Floyd. What about you? Five years later, it feels like it did six years ago. Five years later, we’ve returned to “normal.” And now, perhaps, the fire is burning hotter than ever. So, when I’m gray-haired (God willing), driving across the Burnside Bridge with Black Lives Matter fading in the rearview, I wonder: Will I be crossing into the ashes or a new beginning? Only time will tell. Maybe all that “care” was just… symbolic. Donovan Scribes is an award-winning writer, producer, and owner of the communications consulting firm D Scribes LLC.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/05/05/80043102/seattle-police-trespassed-a-trans-woman-for-being-naked-at-a-queer-nude-beach,The Stranger (Web),Seattle Police Trespassed a Trans Woman for Being Naked at a Queer Nude Beach Just Can't Get Enough?,"On Sunday afternoon, three Seattle Police officers showed up to the queer hangout and nude beach Denny Blaine and told the naked people there that being naked outside, which is legal in Seattle, was actually illegal and that everyone had to put their clothes on. Witnesses who spoke to The Stranger at the beach say the cops stuck around talking to beachgoers for close to two hours, and told one transgender woman, who was lying naked face down on the ground, not to come back to the beach for a week. While police were talking to beachgoers, there was also a man parked at the beach who told an advocate that he was with a private security firm that was representing “community interests.” Advocates and beachgoers confirmed that this was not the first time in recent weeks that police have shown up at the beach investigating claims of lewd activity. Neighbors have been going after the nude beach for over two years now. In late 2023, beachgoers learned of a plan to construct a playground at Denny Blaine, after neighbor and millionaire owner of University Village Stuart Sloan anonymously donated $1 million for its construction. The plan failed after public uproar, but last month Denny Blaine Park for All, a group of neighbors that includes Sloan, sued the city for allegedly allowing the beach to become a “regional venue” for public masturbation and public sex, a characterization that more than 50 beachgoers who’ve spoken to The Stranger in the last year and a half totally dispute. Advocates say that masturbation does happen at the park, but it’s rare, and the overwhelming consensus is that the community knows how to deal with it and that the police do not need to swoop in. The suit also goes after legal nudity, making the argument that the Parks Department is violating its Code of Conduct by depriving neighbors enjoyment of the park. Surely this is remedied by making sure nobody else enjoys it either. Mayor Bruce Harrell’s office has told The Stranger numerous times that he supported the right of people to use the park nude. It did not respond to a Sunday request for comment. The Seattle Police Department, whose public affairs office is closed on weekends, also did not respond to a Sunday request for comment or a Monday morning follow up email. Beachgoers say police arrived around 2:40 pm. Carlos, who didn’t want to use his full name to protect his privacy, says he was lying naked on the grassy upper level of the park when an SPD officer approached him and said he needed to cover up. Carlos, who has been coming to the beach for seven years without issue, told the officer this was not true. He’s right. Nudity has been legal in Seattle since the 1990 case Seattle v. Johnson found a later repealed local law against lewd conduct violated the right to free expression. Washington State has a law against indecent exposure, but SPD guidance posted by former chief Gil Kerlikowske in 2008 says that officers shouldn’t take action unless there’s “lewd or offensive behavior.” Carlos says he was only sunbathing, as was the transgender woman who was trespassed, witnesses say. Carlos says the officer told him she didn’t see the difference between nude sunbathing and indecent exposure. Soon, she was joined by a sergeant and another officer. Carlos texted a telegram group for beachgoers run by Friends of Denny Blaine, the park’s queer-led stewardship group, to sound the alarm about cops telling people to put their clothes on. Colleen Kimseylove, co-founder of the friends group and a key activist who organized against the playground plan, says they rushed over and spoke to all three officers. The responding officer told Kimseylove repeatedly that nudity was not legal in Seattle, “period, end of story.” The sergeant told them that nudity at Denny Blaine was a low enforcement priority and that he thought there had to be a “reasonable solution,” but that “they had been directed by our higher-ups to engage in regular patrols of the park.” “It’s very ominous to speak to representatives of the law in Seattle who don’t know the law of Seattle and are willing to act on the beck and call of millionaires,” Kimseylove says. “It’s not a good feeling.” The officers told Kimseylove that people would be trespassed if they didn’t put their clothes on immediately, or arrested if they proved belligerent. Kimseylove then told the twenty or so people there what the police had said. Whether they chose to cover up was their choice, they said. Only one person, a trans woman, refused. John, a man who sat on a wall at the park with his bike, says the woman shouted that people “did not have to comply,” and several witnesses say she was threatened with arrest. Police told her not to come back to Denny Blaine Park for a week, witnesses say. The Stranger was unable to reach the woman. Several beachgoers say a blonde man parked in a grey Chevy Tahoe, allegedly spoke to one of the officers when she arrived, and they suspected that he made the call. The man would only smile sheepishly at The Stranger, but he would speak to Kimseylove—who says the man did not give his name or the name of his employer but says was hired as private security by “interests in the neighborhood.” This weekend’s events are the most recent in a new wave of neighborhood actions against the beach. In addition to the lawsuit against the city, it seems the Seattle Police have been keeping a special eye on Denny Blaine recently. This isn’t even the first time they’ve told people to put their clothes on. On April 2, Blake Waddell was “Pooh bearing it” (shirt, no pants) at Denny Blaine when an SPD crisis officer approached him and asked about reports of “indecent exposure” at the beach. It was a cold, not so “glorious day” at the beach, Waddell says. Not many people were there. None of them were masturbating. Slipping on his boxer shorts, Waddell explained to the officer the local nudity law and the history of the beach. The officer, who admitted he didn’t know much of that history, stood thumbs in his armpits, and told Waddell that if a parent with a child had been “affronted or surprised” by nudity there, it could count as indecent exposure. The officer also told Waddell that the enforcement priority at Denny Blaine was coming from a “higher level,” echoing what officers told Kimseylove on Sunday. In a recent email, SPD said it did not know the nature of Waddell’s conversation with the officer. Two days later, on April 4, Waddell took video of a police boat cruising slowly by the beach. About thirty minutes later, he says two squad cars rolled up. Waddell again slipped on his boxers to meet them in the parking lot, a little angrier this time. He says three officers stepped out and gave him the “same spiel” about stepped up patrols over reports of public urination and masturbation. Again, Waddell saw nobody urinating or masturbating at the beach. Video shows a mostly empty beach. Waddell, who was at the beach Sunday, says he filed an official on-the-spot complaint with the police sergeant. Another beachgoer and volunteer with Friends of Denny Blaine told The Stranger that he’d been removing invasive blackberries from the shore on March 26 when two Seattle Parks Department Park Rangers told a naked man to either put his clothes on or move to a lower level of the park away from the street. The volunteer talked with the rangers for about 30 minutes, and like Waddell, explained to them both the law and the park’s long history of nude sunbathing. The volunteer emphasized that the rangers, polite and receptive, listened intently. He believed it could have been a mistake. The Parks department told The Stranger that it was a mistake and that the police would take reports of lewd behavior from then on. Beachgoer Nicole Baich says she has also seen police patrol boats cruise slowly by in recent weeks. She called the police presence Sunday “gross.” “I didn’t expect to pull up to the beach at 3 pm on a lovely, cloudless Sunday afternoon and have it be devoid of my friends and culture because of the cop cars that are down here,” she says. “They’re menacing.” John, the man with the bike, didn’t know what to think. His friend Bill sitting on the wall next to him did. He cut in. Bill says he’s come to Denny Blaine for more than ten years. The only people unhappy with the beach were the neighbors. He turned his head to Sloan’s house and said they were here before it was even built. Bill remembers the old brick mansion that used to be there being rolled onto a barge on its way to Bainbridge Island. But even then people complained. They’ve always complained and the cops have answered those complaints by telling them to put their clothes on. They’d comply, only to take them back off when they left. (Back in 1988, The Seattle Times ran a story about police cracking down on topless sunbathing. Even earlier in 1982, The Seattle Gay News ran a similar story of police citing a woman. Nudity wasn’t legal yet, but the women argued the law was sexist. Nobody was cracking down on topless men). “You know, there are people who are wealthy who are naked-friendly, and this would be an ideal house for one of those people to buy,” he says. “They paid premium money for it. Then they could invite us over to their hot tub.” Editor's note: This story has been updated since it's publication. In an interview Sunday, Colleen Kimseylove told The Stranger they had asked people to put their clothes on, but in later text said they had misspoken and had only communicated the possible consequences of remaining nude. The Stranger confirmed with sources who were at the beach Sunday that Kimseylove did not ask people to put their clothes on.",,"['mayor', 'harrell', 'bruce harrell', 'police', 'SPD', 'parks', 'police (title)']",15.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.335745,9685

This year, the Washington Bus and The Stranger's candidate forum was Dungeons & Dragons themed, with drag dungeon mistress Aleksa Manila leading the adventure (with outfit changes, of course!). We learned a lot about the candidates in this year's primary: that Seattle City Council District 2 candidate Adonis Ducksworth might be a Cool Guy Skateboarder, but he's not down to get silly; that D2 candidate Eddie Lin can juggle and walk on his hands; that Katie Wilson used to busk at Pike Place; and that City Attorney Erika Evans always knows the assignment. We also learned just how far D2 candidate Jamie Fackler will go for a bit. He didn't officially make it onstage last night because his campaign hadn't reached the fundraising threshold when event invitations went out, but he still showed up outside dressed as Shrek with a rented donkey and a large bag of onions, and even jumped on stage with City Attorney candidate Rory O'Sullivan (uninvited) to try to hype his performance. In the green room, one candidate said, ""I think we're all processing our Stranger endorsements in these performances."" During the policy section, D2 candidate Jeanie Chunn changed into a stunning green, leafy dress, a shout-out to The Stranger saying she was too ""green"" in our endorsement. We called Wilson's TikToks ""deeply awkward"" (which we stand by), and she said it ""hurt a little bit, but now I feel like I have a reputation to uphold,"" so she decided ""to showcase a talent that's even more deeply awkward."" With less than two weeks to the primary, the candidates showed up, and showed us what they were about. Rinck won best dressed, Evans and Chunn won the most ""inspiration points,"" and Evans won the best overall performance. Now let's see how they do at the ballot box.",,"['city council', 'candidate', 'wilson', 'katie wilson', 'policy', 'candidate (title)']",14.5,2025-08-05T19:10:44.332745,1947

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/08/05/80181591/why-arent-we-using-all-of-our-waterways-to-move-people,The Stranger (Web),Why Aren’t We Using All of Our Waterways to Move People? Just Can't Get Enough?,"We are so moist and soggy in this area. Majestic Puget Sound, glorious Elliott Bay, all those big, juicy lakes, and the super fun(d) Duwamish River. It’s a lot of water and shoreline—1,600 miles in Seattle and on Puget Sound—and it’s just sitting there. Why not plop a few boats down and call it a passenger ferry system? New York did it. Unlike New York, we’re already ferry-philes. For the past 15 years, we’ve had a few walk-on passenger-only ferries. And our car-ferry system is the largest in the US, with 21 vessels and 10 routes. It carried 19.1 million passengers last year alone (about two-thirds of light-rail ridership) despite the ferries sucking rocks lately. Thanks, aging fleet and pandemic-era chaos. Imagine catching a ferry from downtown Seattle to Tacoma and being blinded by sea spray instead of brake lights on I-5. Or criss-crossing Lake Washington on a boat, without dealing with the traffic on a floating bridge. This imagined future is our past. Between the 1880s and 1920s, a slipshod armada of steamships known as the Mosquito Fleet zipped people across the region’s waterways. There were no cars, no bridges, and few roads. Estimates of the Mosquito Fleet’s size vary from 700 to 2,500 ships. There were more than 300 regular stops, but the boats tended to pick up and drop off people anywhere. Boats were our primary people-mover for decades, but the mass production of cars squashed the fleet. But there’s buzz from local wonks, ferry enthusiasts, and politicians who believe we can revive the dream of the Mosquito Fleet. Studies show new ferry routes could better connect the region, cut commutes, and add resiliency to the existing transportation network if emergencies shut down other options. It’d take a lot to make that dream a reality. Despite the Seattle area’s wet roots and Mosquito Fleet past, we only just reintroduced passenger ferries. The Puget Sound region has five publicly run, passenger ferry routes. King County started running the Water Taxi in 2009. In 2017, Kitsap Transit added routes to downtown Seattle from Kingston, Bremerton, and Southworth. Starting in 1989, Washington State Ferries (WSF) had passenger ferries between West Seattle and Bremerton, and Seattle and Vashon Island. Then 1999 happened. In that fateful year, 113 Bremerton residents sued the state, alleging the ferry’s wake damaged the shoreline along Bremerton’s narrow Rich Passage. The plaintiffs won in 2002. The state coughed up $4.5 million in damages and slowed down the passenger ferry so much that it eliminated its appeal. Ridership plummeted. In that same terrible year, voters approved Initiative 695, lowering vehicle excise taxes to $30, thus decimating transportation funding and unleashing the hydra that is anti-tax activist Tim Eyman and his fixation on those darn car tabs. Josh Brown, executive director of the Puget Sound Regional Council, says that initiative all but sank the financial resources for state-run passenger ferries. The state stayed in its car ferry lane. They’re considered an extension of the state highway system, so funds are available. Eventually, local jurisdictions took control. King County created its own ferry district and passed a property tax to fund the Water Taxi. After Kitsap Transit lobbied the state to put ferry funding on the ballot, voters approved a proposed sales tax increase. Passing that ballot measure in 2016 took work, says Steve Sego, a developer and member of the coalition Friends of the Fast Ferry who lobbied to pass it. Sego grew up in Kitsap County and has fond memories of hearing the ferry’s foghorn as it sailed through Rich Passage near his childhood home. He returned to the region after 35 years and expected to find an extensive ferry network. “It was not only not improving, it was going backwards in service,” Sego says. Thanks, in part, to Sego, WSF had the Kitsap Fast Ferry to fill service gaps post-COVID. Washington even funded increased trips along the Bremerton route. However, with WSF service rebounding, the fast ferry Saturday service to Bremerton is on the chopping block, which is wild because people fucking love it. Last year, all that backfilling boosted the route’s ridership numbers 68 percent over what they were two years earlier. Sego says thousands of people have told him the Kitsap routes have improved their lives. Passenger ferries travel twice the speed of car ferries. They also deemphasize car travel, which certainly doesn’t hurt the atmosphere. And they connect car-less passengers with trains and buses. “It’s not just an economic benefit and practical benefit, but it’s a lifestyle and quality of life benefit as well,” Sego says. “The rest of the Puget Sound benefits from having those options.” Setting up new routes should be easy. Look at New York City. In the 1900s, the city had and lost a passenger ferry network. And in 2017, Mayor Bill de Blasio established a new five-borough ferry system. “We do have communities exploring expanded routes today,” Brown says. In 2021, he and his team at Puget Sound Regional Council released their recommendations for new passenger ferry routes, which they based on potential demand, time saved on commutes, and connections to other transit. They suggested a route from downtown Seattle to Tacoma, Lake Washington routes connecting Kenmore, Kirkland, and Renton to the University of Washington, and another between Renton and South Lake Union, all of which would save commute time compared to existing transit options. But the routes face two big barriers, Brown says. Money and space. A new transportation system would cost serious bucks, and we never have enough for transit in this state. That constant problem makes legislators pause when considering new passenger ferries. King County Councilmember Claudia Balducci certainly sees the benefits of the water taxis from Seattle to West Seattle and Seattle to Vashon Island; they’re not only popular, but connect the region. But Balducci thinks people get “very excited” about the open water, maybe too much. She doesn’t think those ferry routes make sense when we could invest in buses and trains, which are effective, efficient, and move more people. Ferries, Balducci says, can look like tourism rather than transit. “It’s not what we should be using our precious transit dollars for,” she says. “Nothing against boats. I love boats.” New York’s new ferry system is kept afloat by big, fat city subsidies that cost taxpayers “nearly a quarter-billion more than officials reported” in a game of hide the numbers, according to amNY. Ferry ridership reached record highs this year, but it is still less than 1 percent of the ridership on NYC’s subways. According to a study from the Puget Sound Regional Council, the route from Seattle to Tacoma would only carry 73,300 passengers a year. The suburban routes on the high end of PSRC’s estimates—UW to Kenmore and UW to Kirkland—would serve around 300,000 people annually. That’s not much. Kitsap Transit Executive Director John Clauson is in the middle of a protracted bid for a dedicated Seattle terminal for the agency’s passenger ferries. Right now, Kitsap Transit shares a downtown dock with the King County Water Taxi that’s only big enough for two vessels. Kitsap has three routes and King County has two, and because it’s Seattle’s dock, Seattle gets priority, Clauson says. Jockeying for a dock is hard, and a Google calendar won’t fix it But even finding a space for this terminal is a nightmare. The three potential spaces are owned by different entities: the Port of Seattle, the City of Seattle, and the state. Clauson’s job exemplifies the real problem with the Mosquito Dream—land ownership. The shoreline is a patchwork of deeds and titles. Consider the hypothetical route to South Lake Union. Do you work out a deal with the Museum of History and Industry, which owns a chunk of dock space, or with that houseboat neighborhood, or maybe the float plane company? The issue with the Lake Washington routes isn’t the dock space in suburbs like Kenmore or Renton, but near UW. A dock could interrupt recreational boating near the Montlake Cut and impede UW’s rowing team. Would the boys in the boat really allow a ferry to interrupt their training path? Would George Clooney? Anyone serious about building that route would need to find out. “You kind of look at the just the analysis, and you realize, ‘Wow, this may be a tougher ask of the public than what I was accounting for,’” Brown says. Sego, ever the optimist, believes the dock challenges are surmountable. He noted that New York’s ferry system has smaller docks and boats with variable loading mechanisms. “It’s really efficient,” Sego says. “You don’t have to overthink this.”",,"['mayor', 'councilmember', 'transportation', 'taxes', 'union', 'ballot measure']",13.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.334746,8734

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/03/07/79956893/city-hall-is-back-on-denny-blaine,The Stranger (Web),City Hall Is Back on Denny Blaine Just Can't Get Enough?,"After trying and failing to erect a playground at Denny Blaine Park, the queer, nude beach on Lake Washington, the millionaire owner of University Village and his wealthy neighbors want a city Park Ranger stopping by to to keep watch for public pee-ers and masturbators at the beach, much to the frustration of the park’s queer-led stewardship group. The move has kicked up a two-year fight between beachgoers and its neighbors—the former to protect a historically queer space, and the latter to exert some control over it. To recap, Stuart Sloan, the aforementioned millionaire, lives next to Denny Blaine Park, which has been a queer, nude beach for at least four decades. Tired of the naked people outside his mansion, Sloan donated $1 million to the city in 2023 to build a children’s playground at Denny Blaine. To ease his plan along, Sloan appeared to leverage his connection with Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell, whose office staff, and staff at the Seattle Parks Department, met with Sloan to update him on its progress. Harrell has denied knowing the identity of the donor, despite the two meeting the day after the city killed the playground and Sloan texting Harrell’s personal cell phone in March 2023 to complain of the “DISGUSTING” nudity at the beach, complete with photos of naked people, whose butts and penises Sloan took the “liberty” of digitally scribbling out. For modesty. (A spokesperson for Sloan previously told The Stranger the only concern was illegal activity, but the photos did not show it and the exchange did not mention it). When Sloan’s plan went public, the gay community saw it for the deterrent it was, and organized, pushing the city to dump the plan and save the summer. Last Spring, neighbors and the activists, who’d by that time formed the Seattle Parks Foundation affiliated Friends of Denny Blaine Park, tried to hash out a solution that would make everyone happy, but those conversations didn’t go anywhere. Neighbors, who formed their own group, Denny Blaine Park for All, took their grievances to Hollingsworth, who said on a recent episode of the podcast Seattle Nice that neighbors thought peeing and masturbation were out of control. Denny Blaine Park for All did not respond to a request for comment. “A small group, I’d say about 10 percent of folks, who go down there and there’s inappropriate behavior,” she said. “Masturbation. Indecent exposure. Relieving themselves in the bushes or in the lake.” If 10 percent of people at Denny Blaine were masturbating and pissing everywhere, it would be an empty, sticky, stinky beach, not a desirable summer spot. Hollingsworth clarified she hadn't promised neighbors a Park Ranger, and conceded the number was just a guess–it could as easily be 0.5 percent–to convey how few people were doing that, and that they were coming from outside the community. To be sure, masturbation happens. When Friends of Denny Blaine Park, the stewardship group that grew from the activist movement to fight the playground, surveyed 58 beachgoers, half said they’d seen masturbation at least once. Most said they had not been sexually harassed at the beach, but those who did had dealt with inappropriate sexual comments, intense staring, and run of the mill creeps pestering them while they sunbathed. But the overwhelming consensus from park goers is that they want the community to handle these incidents, not the city, says Colleen Kimseylove, who co-runs Friends of Denny Blaine. Kimseylove has planned a series of intervention trainings for this summer meant to help people handle the occasional weirdo. Kimseylove thinks the root of that behavior lies in people thinking they’re getting away with something, or that nudity is a secret act. Equipping people with skills to interrupt this behavior keeps the beach a “dignified, safe place for all,” but installing a park ranger, to act as city hall monitor, seemed a step too close to surveillance. “If the concern is inappropriate public behavior, a park ranger is not in the best position to be able to discern that,” Kimseylove said. “Naked public people know naked public behavior best. They’re in the best position to be able to interpret when this has gone from a lonely clueless guy trying to start up conversations with people on the beach to a lonely clueless guy following people around the beach, after they’ve moved themselves around again and again.” Hollingsworth says she understood that privacy concern. “Ideally, what I’d like to see happen is for it to continue to be used how it is, with the gay community,” she said. “Longterm, I would love to see the neighbors join Friends of Denny Blaine; I would love for everyone to come together and work out their issues.” Neighbors had also asked Hollingsworth for additional porta potties, more frequent trash pick up, and to stop people from parking in front of their driveways. On that, they’re mostly aligned with Friends of Denny Blaine. They have been asking the city for additional trash canisters and porta potties for more than a year. Permanent improvements paid for with city money from the Parks Department’s CommUNITY fund, including a study for bathrooms, and accessible stairs are already in the works, says Sophie Amity Debs, who runs the Friends group with Kimseylove. Amity Debs noted Hollingsworth’s appearance at the public meeting in December 2023 that killed the playground plan, where she told the community she’d look into the issue when she took office. “To hear that she seemingly hasn’t been taking action, or meeting with us, and is meeting with Sloan, it doesn’t shock me, but it is disappointing,” Amity Debs said. Hollingsworth says the neighbors initiated the conversations and she’s willing to meet with anyone. Bruce Harrell’s office says the Park Ranger program is meant to reduce the reliance on police, citing 725 incidents it says rangers deescalated last year. Though, when Rangers can’t deescalate a situation, they do call the cops, Parks said. The Mayor’s office did not say if it supported the idea, or why the reduction in parking was a city priority, but acknowledged a “diverse range of opinions” about the beach. The office says the city’s goal is to build trust with park goers through “friendly faces,” which it understood would take time. Parks would listen to park users to “determine appropriate deployment usage,” Mayor Harrell’s office says. Even so, a friendly face may not seem so friendly if it works for the city and you’re naked. . Kimseylove says the group has a public email. If Sloan or neighbors want to work with people who know the “shape of the issue,” they’re not hard to find, they said.",,"['mayor', 'harrell', 'bruce harrell', 'police', 'parks']",12.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.333747,6647

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/07/23/80162567/new-state-legislation-kills-pay-transparency,The Stranger (Web),New State Legislation Kills Pay Transparency Just Can't Get Enough?,"On July 27, our state’s pay transparency law will be amended to effectively end our short-lived era of actually knowing what a job will, you know, pay. Since January 1, 2023, companies that posted jobs in our state were required to clearly state the position’s pay, benefits, and any additional compensation. This was an expansion of the 2018 Equal Pay and Opportunities Act. We the working class were finally saved from blindly applying for jobs in the hopes they would pay a living wage. No more going through rounds of interviews just to find out it was actually a “volunteer” position or some other such nonsense. The law also aimed to combat wage disparities across gender, race, and other protected classes. Under that law, job seekers also had a “private right to action,” meaning if they found a noncompliant post they could theoretically sue the company, with no cap for the penalties a court could impose on the noncompliant business. Well, the business lobby set out to challenge this law on two fronts: our legal system and our state legislature. In early 2024, two King County residents filed separate lawsuits over noncompliance with this law in King County Superior Court against Washington Fine Wine & Spirits, LLC, contending that because the company didn’t list a pay scale for jobs they wanted to apply for, they couldn’t compare them with other open jobs on the market or negotiate an offer effectively. You may think this sounds like an honest mistake by a little LLC. Perhaps we should do what other media outlets have failed to do in reference to this case and clarify that Washington Fine Wine & Spirits, LLC, is owned by Total Wine & More, the alcohol megastore chain with a reported 277 stores nationwide, including 14 in our state, bringing in a reported $6 billion in annual revenue in 2023. A mom and pop shop this is not. Total Wine appealed these two lawsuits to district court and then to our State Supreme Court in the hopes of getting the law struck down, arguing that the law was too onerous for businesses to follow, that these weren’t “bonafide” job applicants (whatever that means), and that the private right to action was creating a “cottage industry” of law firms taking up these cases. Let’s stop right there. A business claimed that a state law was unfair, and also thought it was unfair that they could be held responsible for breaking that law. They even went so far as to argue the plaintiffs weren’t “bonafide.” Can you imagine that ever working with other regulations? Have you ever looked at a speed limit sign, thought to yourself, ""Well, that’s simply too slow,"" kept driving above that speed, and then when you got pulled over, told the cop they weren’t qualified to write you a ticket, and set out to get the speed limit permanently changed to whatever number you think is fair? That’s exactly what happened here. Our state passed a law that businesses simply refused to abide by, and a multibillion-dollar chain used their power to kill it on two fronts. But the wheels of the judicial system move slowly, and they are still waiting on an answer from the Washington State Supreme Court. Lucky for them, a bill in the state legislature could move faster. Their pro-business bill aimed to do three things: 1) implement a period for businesses to correct the noncompliant listings; 2) cap the penalty for noncompliant businesses; and 3) shift the burden of enforcement to job seekers. You read that last part right: the business lobby asked the state legislature to effectively deputize workers into enforcing a state law. If you think this sounds insane, your state representatives don’t agree. On January 21, Republican State Senator Curtis King introduced the original bill, SB 5408, and a largely unchanged version was passed February 28 on a vote of 41-7 with 23 Democrat “yeas.” A decisive win for Big Business. The bill was then sent to the House. It was introduced on March 4, underwent a few minor adjustments in committee, and was passed on April 15 with a vote of 94-1. A blowout. The one no vote in the House? Jeremie Dufault, a Republican representative from District 15. “I had incomplete information on what businesses would be required to do to avoid liability,” he told The Stranger. “After the vote, I discovered that my concerns with the initial bill had been addressed in the final amendment. I support the bill as passed.” The bill was then returned to the Senate for a final vote, where only 1 of the original 7 no voters was left standing: Bob Hasegawa, a Senate Democrat who represents Tukwila and parts of Renton and Kent. So why did this bill get passed, if not on its merits? “I didn’t want to give 5408 a hearing, but as the new Chair of Labor and Commerce, it is important to find ways to work with the ranking minority member of my committee,” says State Senator Rebecca Saldaña to The Stranger. “It is helpful to Senate leadership to have Republican bills so that we can move our priority bills more quickly through the legislative process.“ Politics, am I right? Roughly a month later, on May 20, your Governor Bob Ferguson signed it into law. Just like that: With no real opposition, your state legislature and governor just told businesses that if they don’t like a law that helps working people, they’ll change it until their business buddies are happy. And boy, are they. Union-busting law firm Littler Mendelson reported the development as “welcome news for the business community and a shining example of bipartisan cooperation.” According to the new law, if you see a job posted online in Washington State with no description of salary and benefits, you must provide that business written notice that their listing is noncompliant. The company then has five business days to correct it (and likely blacklist you from the job, of course). If after a business week, the listing is still not following the state law, you can continue your efforts in law enforcement by filing a complaint with Washington State’s Department of Labor & Industries (L&I). If L&I finds that you are correct, the department will attempt to fix the issue with the business via “conference and reconciliation.” If the business still refuses, you can either have L&I assess a penalty or you can contact lawyers to sue—but either way, you won’t get more than $5,000 and may get as little as $100. Good luck finding a lawyer to take that case. If that feels like a big waste of your time and not worth it for you, that’s the point. And what will stop that business from just taking down that posting and putting up an identical noncompliant one, which you would have to file a new complaint about? “We believe the great majority of employers will do their best to follow the law,” says Jeff Mayor from Washington State L&I. Wishful thinking, maybe. According to data shared by Indeed’s Hiring Lab, before the pay transparency expansion of the Equal Pay and Opportunities Act was passed in March 2022, over 65 percent of jobs posted on Indeed in Washington State did not include a transparent description of salary and benefits. By the time the law went into effect on January 1, 2023, that number was cut nearly in half to 33 percent. But businesses in our state were watching those lawsuits closely, and that pay transparency improvement stagnated in August 2024, right around the time that Total Wine & More petitioned King County Superior Court to move the cases up the ladder to district court. Pay transparency has stalled in the year since as businesses waited on an answer from our State Supreme Court and legislature. According to Indeed, more than 10 percent of their 84,000+ current Washington State job listings still do not include salary information, in violation of the current law. And because this law has now been nerfed to oblivion and stripped of enforcement mechanisms, expect that number to climb back up starting on July 27. How high it’ll go, only the “free market” knows.

Turns out, it’s not Seattleites. Next Tuesday, Seattle voters will finish voting on Proposition 1, our first shot at a social housing model. The original proposition—1A on your ballot—proposes a tax on businesses whose employees take home more than $1 million a year. That tax would fund the Seattle Social Housing Developer, which would acquire and build housing that would reliably serve Seattleites who make anywhere from 0 to 120 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI), while guaranteeing that everyone’s rent is 30 percent of their income. (We like this idea and think you should vote for it.) Unsurprisingly, the Seattle Chamber of Commerce isn’t stoked on a new tax on businesses and raised a campaign against it—1B on your ballot—which would attempt to pull from Jumpstart funds (which are already earmarked for entirely different types of low-income housing) and undermines the funding model that makes this social housing so unique. The campaign for 1B has been very visible, especially in our mailboxes, with oversized mailers covered in claims that it’s “for the rich,” or quotes alongside Mayor Bruce Harrell’s face. But who’s funding that campaign? According to The Stranger’s analysis of the campaign donations, almost two-thirds of their funding isn’t even coming from Seattle. It should be obvious that 1B isn’t a people’s initiative, but it’s not a Seattleites’ initiative, either. Let’s dig into it. By the Numbers Okay, let’s start with the big picture. The campaign for 1A, run by House Our Neighbors, has raised $584,740 in itemized campaign contributions, with an average contribution size of $2,367. The campaign for 1B, run by People for Responsible Social Housing (read: the Seattle Chamber of Commerce), raised $425,150, with an average contribution size of $13,286. (I hope we’re all reading that in Bernie Sanders’s voice.) The average campaign size gives us a sense of who’s funding the proposition: 1A has 182 donors who gave less than a thousand dollars; 1B has four. Long Distance Campaigning Most remarkable, though, is how little of 1B’s funding is coming from inside Seattle: 61 percent of their funding comes from Bellevue, Redmond, Mercer Island, Fort Worth, Texas, Washington DC, and Los Angeles. Proposition 1 is a City of Seattle initiative, so other cities shouldn’t have a horse in this race. But looking at where they’re coming from, the $261k in donations is all about protecting big business. Businesses like Amazon, Microsoft, and T-Mobile (totaling $220k in non-Seattle donations) hope to avoid the new tax; And those out-of-state donations? $21k of them represent the real estate industry. Meanwhile, 1A is overwhelmingly funded by Seattleites: 83 percent of their funding has come from inside the city. That, and the fact that they’re funded largely by small-dollar donations, tells us what your gut is probably already telling you: Proposition 1A is a Seattle-grown solution, funded and supported by the people who actually live here. The opposition? A corporate-backed effort bankrolled by big business and out-of-town interests who would very much prefer not to pay their fair share. Voting ends next Tuesday, February 11.

Not porn, not political commentary, not raunchy jokes. A news article, just like this one. According to two employees at Aegis Living, it just happened in King County twice. Jason Bova-Havers says that on their day off on May 27th, a former co-worker sent him something to read: a story published last month in The Stranger titled, “What’s Behind the Gilded Doors of Aegis Living?” The article contained allegations against the senior living chain Aegis Living from employees, former employees, and families of residents, ranging from shady business practices to illegal anti-union actions, discrimination, elder neglect, and more. Bova-Havers had worked for Aegis for the past five years, so naturally they were curious. They told The Stranger that they weren't all that surprised about what was reported in the article, but still felt like it was worth passing along. Maybe this is something my boss should see, they remember thinking, and dropped a link to the story in a group chat he had going with a co-worker and his immediate boss. Two days later, during their shift as a line cook at Aegis Living Shoreline, Bova-Havers was called into the General Manager’s office, their boss’ boss. “You’re going to want to sit down,” Bova-Havers says a Human Resources rep told them. “You recently sent a text message to your coworkers that was seen as ‘below board.’ So we’re letting you go.” That was it. Will Hudson read that same article, also passed to him by a friend. It was about the company he’d worked for the past two and a half years, first as care staff then recently as a member of the maintenance team at Aegis Living Madison. While he was at work the next day he printed the article off in the employee break room so his co-workers could read it, too. “I just wanted to inform them, see what their opinions and takes around it were,” Hudson says. Then he went back to work. “Didn’t think nothing of it.” When Hudson came into work on June 9th, he was called into his boss’s office and questioned. He says they’d interviewed a couple of his co-workers already before he was called in to his boss’s office. “Are you the one who printed off this paper?” he says he was asked. “Yes,” Hudson says he replied. “We don’t allow that here. We have to let you go,” he says he was told. Aegis did not respond to The Stranger’s request for comment about the two fired workers. They also did not respond to repeated requests for comment over months of reporting for the original article, and in the month since publication has not issued any public statement refuting the article’s wide-ranging allegations. Since these firings, SEIU 775 has filed Unfair Labor Practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Aegis Living, alleging the company “unlawfully terminated” the two workers for “concerted, protected activities” covered by the National Labor Relations Act. The complaint states “due to the egregious and hallmark nature of this violation” the union is seeking injunctive relief that would allow these workers to be reinstated with back pay. Even though Bova-Havers and Hudson weren’t members of the union, SEIU sees their firings as an attempt by Aegis to cool pro-union activity. “We're going to push as hard as we can to get them to take action on these complaints,” says Adam Glickman, the Secretary Treasurer of SEIU 775. He sees this as a first-amendment fight, made even more important in the current political climate. “It's just outrageous that in the middle of a workforce crisis where long-term care facilities are struggling to hire caregivers, particularly this company Aegis that pays less than most other employers, that they would fire workers for sharing newspaper articles,” Glickman says. “It seems like a slap in the face to their residents that they care so little about their care that they would fire workers for such an absurd reason. They're so afraid, so anti-union, so afraid of their workers organizing, that they would endanger the care of their residents by firing people for sharing a news article. It's just shocking.” But no matter how it happened, Bova-Havers and Hudson are out of their jobs. Luckily, both Bova-Havers and Hudson have been able to find work since. Bova-Havers is happy at his new full-time job as a pastry chef, which was his original job at Aegis. “I do miss my crew in the kitchen,” he says. “I worry about them. I hope they get better pay and protections. Or, hell, just jobs that appreciate them.” Will has found some work dog sitting and dog walking, but he’s still looking for something long-term. And he’s still upset about what happened. “After being fired, I was devastated,” Will says. “The residents that’d see me every day, now I don’t get to see them anymore. All because Aegis doesn’t want people to know the truth: that Aegis is corrupt.” Have a tip about Aegis Living?

Photography is by Jake Nelson. Last month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made two high-profile arrests in our region: Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino, an Indigenous Mixteco farmworker activist who's been working as a berry picker in and around Skagit County since he was 14; and Lewelyn Dixon, a lab technician at UW Medicine, originally from the Philippines, who moved here 50 years ago. Both of them were transferred to the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma (NWDC)—one of the largest immigration detention facilities in the United States. These aren't the first, nor the last, people detained by ICE in Washington. While we don't have state-by-state numbers, Homeland Security says they've made 32,809 immigration-related arrests nationwide in the first 50 days of the Trump Administration, and the ICE Seattle X account practically fetishizes their local arrests, posting daily photos of people in handcuffs, facing deportation. But Zeferino and Dixon have drawn particular attention. Zeferino has been an activist for farmworker rights in Skagit County, and friends and colleagues suspect he was targeted for his activism. And Dixon, who is a green card holder who came to the US from the Philippines five decades ago, has been held for more than three weeks. Her family and her union at the university, SEIU Local 925, have been rallying for her release. Last weekend, hundreds of migrant advocates and union members rallied in front of NWDC for their release and the release of the 1,500 other detainees at the facility.

https://www.thestranger.com/stranger-election-control-board/2025/07/07/80134055/vote-for-girmay-zahilay-for-king-county-executive,The Stranger (Web),Vote for Girmay Zahilay for King County Executive Just Can't Get Enough?,"For more than a decade and a half, if you asked people in King County what a “County Executive” was, they might’ve said “uh, some guy named Dow Constantine?” Dow’s dynasty (Dow-nasty?) is through and it’s time for Girmay Zahilay to take charge. Zahilay, a charismatic County Council Member first elected in 2019, is already a political staple repping University District, Laurelhurst, Ravenna, Eastlake, Capitol Hill, the Central District, South Seattle, Allentown, and Skyway, but he’s never held such a powerful executive position. He can do it. And, damn it, we want him to. So do the “just fine” establishment dems like Governor Bob Ferguson, cool establishment dems like Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, and moronic warhawks like Congressman Adam Smith. Big tent! He’s also led plenty. In the five-plus years he’s been on the dais, he’s risen to current council chair and prince of fiscal management (or, in boring council speak, chair of the county’s budget and fiscal management committee. Yawn). He introduced the $1 billion Regional Workforce Housing Initiative and led the effort for a $1.2 billion property tax levy to fund mental health treatment centers. He sponsored a $2 million community-based gun violence program. He passed a five-part gun violence prevention program and supports a year-round gun buyback program. He reached these heights by knocking the legendary (read: old, respectfully) civil rights legend Larry Gossett off his perch—a big upset for an unknown lawyer from the South End who ran a nonprofit mentoring middle schoolers and came to this country as a refugee when he was 3. In our endorsement meeting, he even seemed genuinely nervous. He clearly expected our question about the child jail. In his first campaign, he made closing the detention center a huge part of his platform. But in a vote last year, he walked it back. During our endorsement meeting, Zahilay didn’t give a satisfying explanation for why he changed his mind. He says he believed the jail could be transformed with activities and community-based services. When we asked for an example of similar successes, he pointed to close-to-home facilities and “bringing the home to them through the integration of community services.” And it was a bullshit answer when there’s probably a more straightforward version: The county had nothing to replace kid jail, so the council didn’t close kid jail. This is the infrastructure we have, so Zahilay wanted to make it better. We’re not convinced that sour lemon will ever make lemonade, but Zahilay’s only real challenger in this race, County Council Member Claudia Balducci, didn’t vote any differently, and her background directing King County’s Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention is way, way more carceral. That said, these two are pretty politically aligned and did a good job at least pretending they loved each other. We like Balducci, just not as much as Zahilay. She’s a Transit Maven with political experience who is good at getting those Eastside misers to pay for things. And if we have any hope of addressing homelessness and building thousands of units of housing, someone is going to have to convince (or force) those misers to buy the biggest goose in the window (pay taxes) for Tiny Tim (us). Aside from Zahilay’s progressive zeal and résumé, we need someone in the executive's chair who, instead of facing east toward the suburbs à la Balducci, will continue to face South toward the people and places this county has long neglected. At a time the federal government is literally rounding up immigrants and refugees and saying they don’t belong, electing Zahilay is one way we can show all King County residents know they belong and they matter. And we trust he’ll do right by us all. Vote Zahilay.",,"['budget', 'housing', 'homelessness', 'infrastructure', 'taxes']",10.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.315456,3765

https://www.thestranger.com/stranger-election-control-board/2025/07/19/80156072/vote-yes-on-the-king-county-parks-levy,The Stranger (Web),Vote Yes on the King County Parks Levy Just Can't Get Enough?,"Should we or should we not have a county parks system? The question before voters is that simple. Because if voters do not approve this property tax levy, we functionally won’t have one. The 6-year levy, last approved by voters in 2019, will support 250 parks in King County 185 miles of regional trails, 215 miles of backcountry trails and 50 square miles of open space for we, the people, to frolic, picnic, bike, and aimlessly wander. There’s splash parks, pools, ballfields, and play courts of various kinds for racket-oriented aristocrats. If we renew this levy, we maintain that system and homeowners pay 24 cents per thousand dollars of their home value each month. For the median homeowner, that comes out to $16.38 a month. It would generate $1.45 billion over the next six years. If we don’t renew this levy, say goodbye to new infrastructure improvements. Advocates say the county would close parks, or put up signs telling people to recreate at their own risk. Lawns will grow long, hedges wild. After-school programs that depend on county parks funding will suffer. We hope you and your kids like pissing yourselves, because we won’t have anybody to open the restrooms. It’s not a world we want to live in. When the SECB suggested we hold our endorsement meeting in a park, it could not have known we’d meet with this levy’s well-prepared stakeholders on the hottest day of the year so far, a 90+ degree scorcher, with glaring, headache-inducing sunlight bouncing from the concrete like a mirror. We could go on complaining about this thing that was our fault, but it wouldn’t be fair to the people who sat on the porch outside the community center at the genuinely lovely Steve Cox Memorial Park in White Center with us, or the “Log Cabin,” as it is affectionately known. It’d be especially unfair to Fin Crispy Jr., the mascot of the park’s resident summer collegiate baseball team, The DubSea Fish Sticks. They were getting deep fried in there. We didn’t see you leave Fin Crispy Jr., but hope you survived, even if childhood experiences have made some of our stomachs twist into knots whenever mascots are near (it’s a combination of your large size, wide-open, smiling mouths, and mime-like silence. It’s very disconcerting). Like we said, this levy is a no-brainer. It is also uncontested. The advocates, including County Council Member Teresa Mosqueda and Christie True, the county’s former head of natural resources and parks, could have easily shown up, sat down, told us to “vote for this or the parks are screwed,” and called it a day. But they came with data. With a deep love of the parks. Even answers for why the wealthy, who don’t think the county parks are worth a few quarters a day when their backyard, waterfront tennis courts are right there, should vote for this. No matter how rich they are, they don’t own Tiger Mountain, where they race wildly-expensive mountain bikes (yet), or the county-owned pool where little Richie Rich III has his swim meets. If this is you, and “eyesores” are one of your top concerns, consider the weeds. Are you going to schlep a bag and a weeder to your local park, or are you willing to cough up less than a dollar a day so someone else will? We’re willing to bet that’s less than the going rate for a gardener. But those homeowners would probably know better than us. When we pool our money together, we can all have nice things. Even those with little to spare. In Seattle, we’re lousy with parks. But many of the diverse, immigrant populated areas of unincorporated King County aren’t. They depend on this money. Everyone deserves a place to play, to enjoy themselves, to throw a party, to organize a cultural event, and not have to pay for it. Bummed about another property tax? Take it up with the Washington Legislature, which needed to figure out progressive revenue solutions, like, yesterday. Keeping these parks open and thriving at a time when we’re still trying to recover from the isolation and depression of the pandemic and so much public money is under federal threat is literally our civic duty. Vote YES, or don’t let us catch you frolicking in a public green space ever again.",,"['mosqueda', 'teresa mosqueda', 'infrastructure', 'parks', 'parks (title)']",9.5,2025-08-05T19:10:44.333747,4163

Vacancies are rising even as people lament the lack of housing. Eviction and rental policies must change. Crime and public safety loom large in the race for governor and for good reason, statistics show. Among the most glaring is the low number... Seattle hosts about a dozen merlins in tall trees. They are tough to see, just like the behind-the-scenes politics of the city's tree protection efforts. If Seattle is to live up to its values of tolerance and inclusion, the mainstream Jewish community must be part of difficult conversations about Gaza. There is something very basic that local governments could do to help downtown Seattle pull out of its nosedive. A 2021 shooting investigation that pitted a nonprofit against the King County prosecutor underscores the ethical aspects of violence-prevention programs. A small number of state lawmakers are raising alarms about high-potency cannabis products. They face an uphill fight. It's time for the public to weigh... The Nov. 7 election forces a basic question of what kind of city Seattle will be when the final votes are tallied. People in drug crisis are not often encouraged by outreach workers to get treatment. Some say that should change. The historic heat in July prompted a lot of complaints but not a lot of action. That could change with leadership at the top.","July 10, 2024 at 11:00 am June 23, 2024 at 6:00 am May 24, 2024 at 3:07 pm April 26, 2024 at 3:13 pm March 7, 2024 at 12:24 pm January 19, 2024 at 2:14 pm December 15, 2023 at 2:00 pm October 20, 2023 at 4:00 pm September 22, 2023 at 1:57 pm August 18, 2023 at 2:48 pm","['election', 'housing', 'public safety', 'workers']",9.0,2025-08-05T19:17:42.332587,1366

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/06/30/80124841/dems-mamdani-is-not-extreme,The Stranger (Web),"Dems, Mamdani Is Not Extreme Just Can't Get Enough?","At this point, we must conclude that the principal function of ICE isn’t the enforcement of immigration laws, but the occupation and policing of cities. “[We] must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America’s largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside,” Trump posted on TruthSocial, not long after the rain fell, in every way, on his June 14 military parade, and, more significantly, while millions of Americans protested his brazen “will to [authoritarian] power.” Trump then described “Radical Left Democrats” as “sick in the mind,” unpatriotic, and so on and so forth. And then Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic primary in New York City on Tuesday, June 24. He is an immigrant, a socialist, and a Muslim. He is the embodiment of all that is considered wicked in our hyper-MAGA times. The message issued from this stunning victory against America's increasingly and frustratingly milquetoast center-left—a center-left whose leading strategy for Trump’s authoritarianism is to do nothing and let it somehow burn out on its own—is that something must be done. Our values, which are under attack, must be asserted, even if that means imprisonment. It is illegal to kidnap brown (or any kind of) people from the streets or our cities. The US is, and has always been, a multicultural society. This assertion is at the heart of the protests on the streets of LA and the ballots in NYC. But first, we must understand the core of the developments that led us to where we are now. The line in Trump’s June 14 post that requires our attention is found here: “[City people] believe in Open Borders, Transgender for Everybody, and Men playing in Women’s sports.” When you identify cosmopolitan values with lawbreaking, then those values are, in this interpretation, criminal. And so you have crime in the streets, and crime in Pride parades, and crime even in City Hall. On Tuesday, June 17, Brad Lander—New York City’s comptroller, a progressive, and a candidate in the recent NYC primary that saw Andrew Cuomo and the Dems’ conservatives go down in flames—was manhandled and arrested by ICE thugs for doing his job in a court of law. Before that, the thugs did pretty much the same thing to a California senator for legally participating in a Homeland Security press conference. And before that, it was the mayor of Newark, who, again, was doing nothing more than following the law. The appearance of ICE in blue states—blue because they are dominated by their urban centers—doesn’t explain, of course, the essence of this appearance, which has its source in the GOP’s long and steady project of repressing the Black vote. With ICE, voter repression leaves the judiciary apparatus and enters the US’s repressive apparatus, which includes the conventional police (by means of compliance), immigration enforcement, and the army, as demonstrated by the National Guard’s current and ever-expanding occupation of Los Angeles. This occupation, which will eventually expand to all major metropolitan areas, has as its mission the enervation of the blue voters. Why? The GOP, which first lost command of the white vote in cities and, gradually, the suburbs, is in actuality the minority party. Without certain institutional (and therefore structural) advantages, the country should have long accepted the obvious fact of its multiculturalness and been organized by a politics that spanned from the likes of Joe Biden (conservative) to the likes of Mamdani (progressive). Trump would be unelectable if our national democracy were as robustly representative as in states such as California, New York, and, of course, Washington. The urban values supported by the Democratic Party should be regarded as conventional, as the usual, as the everyday. What must be registered as bizarre is not Mamdani, but Stephen Miller. The former actually represents, like the current composition of the Supreme Court, a small segment of America, but is, instead, the expression of a larger political structure that artificially amplifies his voice and views. If the left does not grasp the fact that what is at stake is our lopsided democracy, then we will continue fighting against apparitions (“more should be done to attract MAGA voters,” “Mamdani is a radical,” and so on), but not the real stuff of American life. During his first term in office, Trump continued the GOP’s repression of the Black vote but left urban white voters, who over the past 30 years moved from the graveyard of the right to the spectrum on the left, unbothered. Not so with his second term. He is going after them with the hope of grinding what’s left of American democracy into the dust. This is where ICE comes into the picture. It’s not really about brown people (who, nevertheless, pay the traumatic price of ICE’s brazen lawbreaking); it’s about the white voters who, through urban processes, became liberated not so much from racism (we still have lots of that, even in progressive Seattle) but from the hot, anti-immigrant stuff of Trump’s rallies. Stephen Miller Invokes Racist Conspiracy Theory To Dismiss Mamdani newrepublic.com/post/197219/...[image or embed] And so, this is where things presently stand, Seattle. Los Angeles is coming our way, and it will definitely be a time of trouble, a time when our values are bombarded daily, when America’s white nationalist minority oppresses its multicultural majority. So, how are we going to come? Let’s turn to New York City for an answer.",,"['mayor', 'candidate', 'police']",8.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.300930,5535
https://www.thestranger.com/stranger-election-control-board/2025/04/18/80019769/vote-no-on-king-county-proposition-1,The Stranger (Web),"Vote ""No"" on King County Proposition 1 Just Can't Get Enough?","It’s time to dig through your pile of unpaid bills and Safeway coupons. We’ve got a special election coming, and your ballot’s due on Tuesday. Let's get into it. At its simplest, King County Proposition 1 is a levy renewal. It would continue funding the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), a massive biometric database that stores over 3 million fingerprint and palm print records and helps police connect prints left at crime scenes to people. It also confirms the identities of arrestees, preventing people from being wrongfully detained or released under false names. On its face, Prop 1 may seem tempting enough. This is, after all, a levy with no organized opposition (as you’ll see on your ballot), endorsed by nearly all King County Councilmembers (yep, even the ones you like), and designed to renew a decades-old program that helps solve crimes and identify the dead, sometimes those beyond recognition. It’s relatively inexpensive—about $24 a year for the average homeowner—and funds forensic infrastructure across 39 cities and unincorporated King County. There’s no question that it’s better for local police departments to share a centralized, taxpayer-funded forensic system than to duplicate these services piecemeal at additional public cost. The people who currently run AFIS do seem to take privacy concerns seriously. Additionally, the system doesn’t store citizenship data, and it complies with King County’s ban on facial recognition. As of now, AFIS doesn’t collaborate with ICE (because of the Keep Washington Working Act), doesn’t scoop up facial scans, and doesn’t seem particularly interested in expanding beyond its current scope. But what if that changes? But even reasonable-sounding systems can be dangerous when left unscrutinized. Surveillance overreach isn’t tinfoil hat anymore. It’s a Tuesday. And surveillance tools rarely stay in their lane for long. We can't afford to blindly renew government tracking tools—no matter how routine—without first demanding detailed accountability, privacy protections, and public oversight. We asked Tee Sannon, the Technology Policy Program Director at the ACLU of Washington, and she flagged serious concerns about AFIS—from its potential for abuse to the lack of public transparency around how the system actually works. While the ACLU hasn’t taken an official stance on Prop 1 (they didn’t last time either), Sannon made it clear that questions about how this biometric data is managed, and what might happen to it down the line—are more urgent than ever in today’s political climate. Could this data be repurposed later? Used in ways the public never agreed to? That uncertainty alone should give us pause. AFIS is a surveillance system, and like all surveillance systems, it lives inside a criminal legal infrastructure with a long and ongoing track record of racism, data misuse, and mission creep. And right now, this system operates with little meaningful public oversight, and just as little transparency about how it impacts the communities most likely to be swept up in it. Back in 2018, we told voters to reject the AFIS levy because it came bundled with facial recognition software, tech we didn’t want then and still don’t trust now. To their credit, the county banned facial recognition in 2021, and AFIS officials say the software has been disabled. But pay special attention to that word: disabled, not deleted. Not dismantled. We shouldn’t expect the erosion of civil liberties to creep at a snail's place. Change is coming at the speed and volume of an avalanche. The federal government is hoarding surveillance powers and conducting warrantless data grabs. It’s proudly throwing immigrants like Kilmar Ábrego García in foreign prisons they may never escape. And the ICE snatch job on Rumeysa Ozturk, taken into an unmarked van by plainclothes federal agents, looked awfully like a secret police operation. Our civil liberties aren’t being chipped away at, they’re being jackhammered. So forgive us if we’re slightly suspicious of any system that collects biometric data on hundreds of thousands of people, promises it’s “just for fingerprints,” and asks us to trust that it will never, ever be used for anything nefarious. This time around, Prop 1 supporters say there’s nothing to worry about. No facial recognition. No new biometrics. No big expansion. Just a routine renewal. Just trust us. We’d be skeptical of that any day, but today? Today the federal government is pulling every lever it can find to surveil the population and amass information that can support its agenda of mass deportations—and that’s just what’s happening three months into the administration. Prop 1 allows data collected by AFIS to be shared with state and federal agencies—including the FBI—without any clear, enforceable restrictions. Once that data leaves King County’s hands, the Keep Washington Working Act (which keeps Washington law enforcement from participating in immigration enforcement) doesn’t protect our state’s immigrants. The data AFIS collects can be repurposed for uses that are opaque to the public and often hostile to civil liberties. Worse, the public has no real way to see how the system is being used. AFIS doesn’t publish regular audits or racial breakdowns of whose prints are in the system. There are no citizen oversight bodies empowered to review its operations. There are no requirements for public disclosure when policies change or technologies expand. AFIS is a biometric dragnet in an era when rights are increasingly fragile, and when the difference between “not used for this” and “can’t legally be used for this” matters more than ever. Supporters of Prop 1 argue that rejecting this levy will delay investigations, hurt cold case resolution, and force local departments to pay more for worse systems. That might be true. But that’s an indictment of how little effort has been made to rebuild AFIS into something accountable and transparent, not a reason to keep funding it without conditions. Voting no on Prop 1 is a vote demanding more from a system that has quietly amassed the biometric data of millions of people and is asking for our continued trust with almost no strings attached. We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: Surveillance systems don’t get safer when we stop paying attention. They expand when we’re distracted. They deepen when we stop asking questions. And eventually, predictably, they turn toward us. We’re in a crisis of government, morality, and sanity right now.

In a Tuesday press release, Attorney General Pamela Bondi stated, ""Sanctuary policies impede law enforcement and put American citizens at risk by design."" RELATED | Trump admin. continues to clash with 'sanctuary cities' She added that the Department of Justice will continue to litigate against these jurisdictions and collaborate with the Department of Homeland Security to eliminate such policies nationwide. The list follows President Trump's Executive Order 14287, signed on April 28, 2025, which aims to protect American communities from ""criminal aliens."" The order stated the need for the federal government to restore the enforcement of U.S. law and directs the Justice Department to identify jurisdictions that obstruct federal immigration laws. The identified sanctuary states include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. Counties listed are Baltimore County, Maryland; Cook County, Illinois; San Diego County, California; and San Francisco County, California. Cities named include Albuquerque, New Mexico; Berkeley, California; Boston, Massachusetts; Chicago, Illinois; Denver, Colorado; East Lansing, Michigan; Hoboken, New Jersey; Jersey City, New Jersey; Los Angeles, California; New Orleans, Louisiana; New York City, New York; Newark, New Jersey; Paterson, New Jersey; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Portland, Oregon; Rochester, New York; Seattle, Washington; and San Francisco City, California. In recent months, the Justice Department filed several lawsuits against sanctuary jurisdictions, including one against New York City on July 24. The DOJ stated that the federal government will help any jurisdiction that desires to be taken off the list to identify and eliminate its sanctuary policies, so it no longer stands in opposition to federal immigration enforcement. Previously, Seattle joined a lawsuit with other major cities that were being threatened with the loss of federal funding if they did not comply with immigration enforcement. LEARN MORE | City of Seattle joins lawsuit over federal funding threats to sanctuary cities Seattle uses the term ""Welcoming City"" to describe a city ordinance that instructs city employees not to inquire about a person's immigration status unless they are legally required to do so. The ""Welcoming City"" laws have been on the books since 2003. ""It is well within our authority to direct our employees in this manner,"" City Attorney Ann Davison said. “We do not obstruct federal law - we comply with all federal laws and believe that having what we call a ‘welcoming city’ is lawful."" In February, a memo issued by Bondi said sanctuary jurisdictions ""should not receive access to federal grants administered by the Department of Justice."" The memo also threatened civil and criminal prosecution of jurisdictions or local officials who do not comply with federal immigration laws. The lawsuit that Seattle joined said local sanctuary policies do not interfere with federal law. ""Plaintiffs are not going to stand in the way of lawful federal immigration enforcement,"" the lawsuit states. ""But neither are they going to be bullied into abandoning their laws that have made their communities safer or doing what the federal government cannot compel them to do—actively assist the federal government in enforcing federal immigration laws."" The lawsuit alleged Seattle's welcoming city law, along with the sanctuary laws of the other plaintiff cities comply with federal law. ""These local policy choices are not designed to, and do not, interfere with federal law enforcement, but instead ensure that all residents of Plaintiffs’ communities—regardless of immigration status—feel safe reporting crimes, going to schools, seeking medical care, and accessing critical public services,"" the lawsuit states. While Seattle was ready to dig in its heels to defend its laws, Washington State Republican Party Chair Jim Walsh told KOMO News he believed it would benefit the city to aid Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in identifying and apprehending offenders who are in the country illegally. “I think they are playing a losing hand in the long run,"" Walsh said. “There needs to be cooperation between the local agencies and the federal agencies. That doesn’t mean the local agencies have to the feds job, but there should be cooperation. It’s not inappropriate that the federal government say ‘look, if you’re not going to honor our detainers, we’re not going to honor financial support to you’.” Aside from federal funding tension, Seattle has hosted several high-profile incidents opposing ICE and immigration laws, ranging from large-scale protests to various lawsuits.",,"['davison', 'ann davison', 'policy', 'ordinance']",8.0,2025-08-05T19:12:18.851772,5150
https://www.thestranger.com/queer/2025/02/08/79911998/trump-order-causing-document-troubles-for-trans-people,The Stranger (Web),Trump Order Causing Document Troubles for Trans People Just Can't Get Enough?,"President Donald Trump’s first two and a half weeks in office threw the lives of transgender people in the US into chaos. Through executive orders, he’s moved to ban trans women and girls from sports, ban federal support of gender-affirming care for people age 19 and younger, and set the stage for a trans military ban under the Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. But no order has likely affected more trans people than the first he signed on Day 1 of his presidency, or “Defending Women From Gender Ideology and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” The order is a federal redefinition of sex—scrubbing all mention of trans people and trans-friendly policy from federal websites, directing federal prisons to remove trans people from the facilities that don’t align with their birth sex, banning the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care (a directive to effectively detransition those same federal prisoners who can’t get hormones any other place) and forcing trans people on Medicaid to pay for pricey drugs out of pocket. At some point, the Office of Personnel Management and Homeland Security will implement changes that require “government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards to accurately reflect the holder’s sex.” Legal challenges are already filed, including a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union challenging the state department’s “refusal to issue accurate sex designations”—these are not laws, they’re directives, and likely unconstitutional power grabs from the executive branch—but so are changes to federal policy. As we wrote last week, trans people can no longer update the gender marker on their passport or the one on file with the Social Security Administration, because, based on this redefinition, we don’t exactly have “gender markers” anymore. Instead, Trump replaced them with sex markers. His administration believes sex is locked at conception. Technically speaking, we’re nothing. We’re sexless. But the complexities, and come to think of it, simplicities, of biology, the prevalence of intersex conditions visible and invisible to the naked eye, and the demonstrable reality of gender variance in daily life, across cultures, and throughout time, is just hooey, they say. Woke, meaningless, irrelevant nonsense that must be snuffed out. We’re starting to see this ideology in practice, and it’s creating real, practical problems for trans people. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has frozen applications from people who’ve requested “X” markers or a binary change of gender, according to Denise Diskin a volunteer attorney with the LGBTQ legal advocacy organization QLaw. It now appears the only one in the business of changing gender markers is Trump: Trans people who have secured emergency replacement passports have had them returned with their gender assigned at birth. To renew a passport, applicants must send in their current one, meaning that many now find themselves without a passport and no clear timeline for when they’ll get one back. In a Friday press release, The ACLU said that 1,500 transgender people or their families had contacted the organization, reporting suspended or pending passport applications. Along with switching gender to sex on federal forms and documents, Trump’s order revoked the option for a gender neutral “X” marker on passports for non-binary people, intersex people, or anyone else who didn’t want a sex identification on their travel document. For Camins Bretts, a bald trans man with a beard and taste for expensive menswear, an “X” marker is practical. His appearance has confused border patrol agents since the 1980s. When he appeared to be a butch woman, agents saw a man fraudulently using a woman’s passport. He had the same problem after he transitioned, and really was a man using a woman’s passport. Bretts recalled all the times he’d been detained at reentry for “false documents” and laughed. “I mean, it’s a story every trans person tells me,” he says. “That’s not unique.” How he’s gendered often depends on who’s looking. The “X” marker could’ve at least put an end to consistent border troubles. On January 22, Bretts applied for an emergency passport with an “X” marker, and scheduled an appointment to pick it up on the 27th, hoping to make some last minute travel plans with friends. A few hours after Rubio reportedly sent a memo to state department employees ending the use of X markers and halting gender marker changes, Bretts’ passport momentarily disappeared in the tracking system and then reappeared three days later. At the appointment, a woman told Bretts their passport was on hold. When Bretts asked for written documentation of that, she said there was none, and no appeals process, either. Looking distressed, the woman told Bretts to print out the executive order as documentation. A supervisor nodded his head behind her. Bretts was unable to apply for a new passport under their assigned gender at birth because the Department had previously issued Bretts passports with both male and female markers. He walked away from the appointment with nothing, and no recourse, so he contacted their congressperson Pramila Jayapal and several legal organizations. On Tuesday, the Seattle passport office called to reaffirm they were not processing “X” passports. Bretts asked if that was a denial of their application, but the office couldn’t say. He’s since received notifications that their application was complete. “Called [passport] helpline,” they texted. “Still Schrodinger’s passport—‘getting ready to manufacture book and card’ according to [the] agent … They could/would not answer my q’s about when it will be ready and what gender is in it.” Evan Reding, a 24-year-old trans masculine person who passes as a cis man in daily life, says having an “F” on his passport is more of a safety concern than anything else. He hadn’t updated any of his documents prior to election day last year, but legally changed his name in December and sent in an application for a new, expedited passport on January 10th, expecting it back by at least January 31. A tracker on the State Department website shows his passport as “processing.” He checks it at least twice a day. He expects to receive a passport with an “F,” but scraping together the $600 he needed to update everything before Trump took office wasn’t easy. Reding says he wouldn’t have been able to do it without his mom’s help. The other trans people, and parents of trans children, who spoke with The Stranger asked us to use their first name or pseudonyms to protect their identities. Bailey, a trans woman also waiting for her passport, says she can afford to lose the $270 she spent, but it’s not why she went through this process. The thought that her passport may return with an “M” marker, adds to her prevailing feeling that the people in charge of this country hate her and people like her. In the months before Trump’s inauguration, 24-year-old Shiloh updated all their documents with a new name and gender marker, except the one on file with the Social Security Administration. Biggest face palm of his life, he says. It’d slipped his mind while recovering from top surgery; it’s also easy to forget. Social Security cards don’t have gender markers. They’re only visible from a SSA database called NUMIDENT, or Numerical Identification System. Shiloh evidently got lucky, or at least secured a just in time appointment with the office. They changed their marker more than a week after Trump’s order went into effect. Four days later, the SSA sent workers an “emergency message” telling them not to process gender marker changes, and to tell applicants they were “not able to accept or process a sex field change,” according to reporting from independent journalist Chris Geidner. The policy is now posted on the agency’s website. James’ daughter is trans, and they’re having trouble getting her a new passport from the State Department. They wanted to update her “X” passport to an “F,” but it’s lost in the government ether now. The family has to decide by Thursday whether or not to cancel an upcoming vacation overseas. James estimates the non-refundable hotel stay and plane tickets will be in the $10,000 range. She’s suggested staying with her grandparents if they can’t work it out in time. But money is just money, he says. But James wonders what would happen if she really needed to leave, and that passport was locked in some kind of bureaucratic morass. James has texted us regular updates about the family’s troubles. On Tuesday, they discovered Social Security processed the name change they’d submitted, but left the gender marker as “M.” That morning, he’d tried talking his way into a passport at a local office—hers was currently listed as “X.” James tried handing the employees his daughter’s updated Washington birth certificate, but says they had a record of the M on her previous passport. “They have no guidance on how to issue one otherwise since X doesn’t exist anymore,” he wrote. “I think having a passport, regardless of gender is better than no passport and being stuck.” The employees were compassionate, and heard him out even though he did not have an appointment, but there was nothing they could do but escalate his problem to their supervisor, who told him to come back with his daughter on Wednesday and submit a new application with an “M” marker. While waiting, he says he overheard employees tell a trans woman that the process had changed, and they’d mail her a passport. She flew in from Alaska, he says. James returned with his daughter on Wednesday, they were told the legal department would have to review her application. He had to write a letter explaining their situation. “I have to go back Friday and either there will be a passport or a letter from legal denying it.” James got neither. The passport office called Friday and explained they were still waiting for guidance, meaning his daughter's passport would remain in limbo. James cancelled the first leg of the family vacation. If things change, they’ll rebook. If they don’t, well, he isn’t so sure. Liz’s trans son came out shortly after the family moved from Seattle to rural Washington. She joked that he should have come out when they lived someplace with resources. But they’ve managed. “Surprisingly,” she said, he’s not the only trans kid. There’s a small community of families like theirs. He’s out at school. His identity is not a secret. Anyone who knows him knows he’s trans, which didn’t stop his civics teacher from polling his class on whether broad acceptance of trans people would be very bad for society. Eighty percent of them said “very bad.” Liz submitted a passport application for her son with an “M” marker on December 23, and arrived a week later on January 1. Liz paid for expedited service, and says the online tracker showed it would arrive in two to three weeks. Five weeks later, it still hasn’t. The tracker shows it is “in process.” Liz thinks her son’s delayed passport has been overwhelming for him, but his main concern is missing out on a trip to Asia this spring. He doesn’t understand the gravity of the situation in the way she does. No one around her seems to. She says it’s as if people almost expect trans people to be discriminated against. They don’t see these orders as extreme as they should. “The thought of an American citizen being denied this and that being okay with people—not just my son, but all trans and non-binary kids and adults,” she says. “To oppress a whole group of people on a federal level. That’s what scares me.”",,"['election', 'union', 'workers', 'policy']",8.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.307169,11638

The people there surely felt it, but no one, according to recent reports, was killed or seriously injured. The world-historical seismic event triggered tsunami warnings in Hawaii, French Polynesia, Japan, Peru, and Chile. It seems our planet's largest ocean was sloshing about like bathtub water bothered by a soap-lathering bather. This morning, however, almost all tsunami warnings have been downgraded, and the shores of our region of America—California, Oregon, Washington—only experienced waves that were more curious than destructive. Now, let's get back to the Epstein files. No, let's talk about the weather instead. The experts predict that today will be as hot as yesterday, reaching a very uncomfortable 81. But starting tomorrow, things will start to get cooler and cooler. Indeed, next week will open with temperatures in the low 70s. The chance of rain, however, will remain depressingly low. Sorry trees, sorry grass, sorry to all of the life forms that use sunlight and water to produce out of thin air the most original food in the world. Columbia Funeral Home and Crematory, which has been around forever (since 1907), was damaged to a considerable degree by a fire that the Seattle Fire Department confronted at 4 am this morning and extinguished an hour and half later. The funeral home, which is famous for displaying glowing Nativity ornaments on its lawn during the holiday season, had planned to send one of the city's souls to the other side of eternity this Friday. That's not going to happen. Though SFD claimed ""no one [was] in the building when the fire broke out,"" it's uncertain if it categorized a dead person as ""no one."" Nevertheless, investigators believe that arson is at the bottom of this bad business. The Pacific Science Center's huge mechanical dinosaurs will lose their jobs after Labor Day. For four decades, these ""animatronic beasts"" did their damndest to please young and old visitors. And all for what? To get the boot. Their bosses had this to say about them: “They’ve far exceeded expectations thanks to the tireless, heroic efforts of our Pacific Science Center staff.” Where do they go from here? No one wants to say. But they will be replaced by an exhibit devoted to spiders. Who cares that Finland's geese turn the food they consume into waste? What is the story here, Seattle Times? Someone or another had this to say about Helsinki's public beaches: “[They are covered by] a shocking amount of [goose] poop.” But visit the park—Creekside Park—next to Vancouver BC's palatial Pacific Central Station, and you will also a ""shocking amount of [goose] poop."" Do I have to say it? Yes, I must. Shit happens. And what's this? A 15-year-old boy from a drive-past town in southwest Washington, Chehalis, wants to become, when he is old enough, the governor of a state whose GNP is approaching $1 trillion and, as a consequence, has the 4th-highest GDP per capita in the nation. The boy is a Republican. He wants to give lots of money to cops. He also thinks taxes are very bad, and so on and so on. But will someone in Chehalis tell this boy that Washington State is already on the A-list when it comes to capitalism. We, a blue state (surprise!), slam dunk that shit like Sasquatch launched from a trampoline. In short, we couldn't do the big business of accumulating capital any better. You, my boy, live at the end of the world, when it comes down to private enterprise. Now, go back to school, put on the cap with the propeller, and try to think of something that our state doesn't do so well. Something we are truly lousy at. Will someone also tell the boy in Chehalis that climate change is really something that should be on his mind? The world is already getting hotter by the day; and it's going to be even hotter in 2028, the year he plans to run for the highest office in this state. Smoke from the Bear Gulch Fire in the Olympic National Park has finally reached the Puget Sound. The fire, which was first reported two days after Independence Day, and, presently, is only 10 percent contained, has already burnt more than 1000 acres to a crisp. Now that FEMA is being dismantled, we are required to learn from ""extreme weather survivors"" the best way to deal with a disaster on your own. Please forward this message to the people of islands in the Pacific, Bangladesh and Somalia. The present aggressive and unrelenting restructuring of American society uses old tools to build something that's unprecedented: subjects who are adapted to accelerating value formation and concentration in a world whose climate has changed dramatically. The destruction of FEMA, basic weather monitoring, NASA's climate science has its logic in the formation of a population that will be spiritually (which is the same as physically) powerless upon the full arrival of a geological era that will demand, if an approximation of a morally adequate response is to be achieved, greater social cooperation and, as a consequence, the deceleration, if not entire replacement, of the dream of endless economic growth. ICE, concentration camps, the brazen shredding of basic civil rights—clearly, we are being conditioned for the continuation of surplus value accumulation in the ecological aftermath. This is bizarre indeed. But the Department of the Treasury is accepting donations via Venmo to help reduce the US’ $36 trillion debt. Do not do this. It’s the dumbest thing ever proposed in the history of American finance. And not because your pennies will not make a dent on this debt; it’s dumb because the US keeps cutting taxes on the rich and the corporations they own. This Venmo thing is nothing but a performance to make the greatest tools among us feel patriotic. What’s next? A GoFundMe for the US government? For real, a fool and their money soon part.

If you came out to the No Kings rally on Saturday, you found out. An estimated 70,000 protesters gathered at Cal Anderson for a rally, where Rep. Pramila Jayapal, labor leaders, immigrant rights advocates, and federal workers all spoke. “This is gonna require a lot of us. We have to adjust ourselves. We have to dig even more deeply,” Jayapal said. “I’m not ashamed to say I’ve got moments of fear. Of course I do, and so do you. But you and I are more than afraid. We are furious.” After the speeches, the rally snaked down Pine St., spanning almost two miles from end-to-end. The “No Kings” branding was strong, but less memorable than Seattle’s handmade signs: “I hate big crowds up I hate fascism more;” “ICE=Gestapo (btw that’s bad);” “Aspire to live like a Tsar, plan to go out like one.” One woman carried a head on a bloody pike wearing a rubber pig mask, crown and blonde wig. It’s true that the Hands Off and No Kings marches are easy and accessible. They’re not radical whatsoever. At the same time, they’re undeniable evidence at least 5 million Americans find Trump’s policies intolerable: Americans head-to-toe in black, with keffiyehs around their necks, in yoga pants, or with children on their hips, all acting as a single counterpoint to Trump’s failed show of authoritarian military power in Washington DC. Crowds were so sparse and quiet the squeak of tank wheels could be heard on livestreams of the parade. Now, if the marches really are just a pretext to raise funds for a toothless Democratic party, or these signs are left to collect dust like all the pink hats from the record-breaking Women’s March, they very well may be meaningless. But they can also act as an invitation for people to do more than show up once, post on their Instagram story, and call it a day. Marches like this are nice, but they’re the beginning of resistance, not the end. From a stage at Cal Anderson, King Youngblood’s Cameron Lavi-Jones told the crowd voting in local elections could help protect their neighbors, but their “presence cannot just stop at the polls.” “For those that are able—we need you to show up and disrupt the spaces where injustices are taking place in front of our eyes. Including the rallies and protests that are not as comfortable as this one,” the 26-year-old rock musician said. One of those protests was happening 10 miles south of the park: In Tukwila, protesters made a blockade across the facility’s exits out of homemade shields, no parking signs and their own bodies, hoping to keep two immigrants from being taken into detention in Tacoma. Around 3 pm, Tukwila police and the ICE SWAT team used at least two different types of chemical weapons on the small crowd in order to break through. As the march made its way from Cal Anderson to Seattle Center, Marsha, 78, told The Stranger she was visiting family in Seattle from Tuscon, and joined the march. Before No Kings, the last two protests she’d been to were the 2017 Women’s March, and Selma. “What’s happening is appalling,” she said, “that you arrest and trample on the rights of the poorest people, the people that have the least resources, and that you demonize them.” Daniel, a chef, showed up because he isn’t able to keep his employees safe. He says he feels powerless, but “I feel like if we unite as people we could do more.” Hibi, a Somali immigrant who came to the US as a young child, and has lived in Seattle for more than a decade. “Once he left office, we felt like things were going to get better,” she says. But she wasn’t too surprised when he was reelected. She and her immediate family are documented, and have been for years, but she says two family friends were detained at the Tukwila ICE office less than two weeks earlier. They came to the US seeking asylum, she says. “I’m not really hopeful a lot will change,” she says. “But I’m hoping.” Nationwide, the ACLU estimated that some 5 million people marched in all 50 states. Most were lowkey and peaceful, but there was still a backdrop of violence across the country. Earlier that morning, a gunman approached two state lawmakers' homes wearing a latex mask and a police uniform. He shot and killed former Democratic State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark; He also shot Democratic State Senator John A. Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, who both survived. When Boelter was arrested, authorities found a list of about 70 potential targets, including politicians, civic and business leaders, and Planned Parenthood centers. In Utah, a man entered the crowd with what appeared to be an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, and when armed “peacekeepers” fired at him, they shot and killed a bystander, 39-year-old fashion designer Arthur Folasa Ah Loo. And in Texas, law enforcement arrested one person connected with a credible threat of violence against local politicians that planned to attend the No Kings march in Austin, the state capitol. Meanwhile, federal law enforcement cracked down on anti-ICE protests. In Los Angeles, police fired flash bangs and tear gas into protesting crowds, and at federal buildings in the city, US Marines guarded federal buildings with rifles, and ICE SWAT teams reportedly tackled at least one protester to the ground.

https://www.thestranger.com/mountain-dispatch/2024/12/11/79820309/the-abortion-haven-in-the-mountain-west,The Stranger (Web),The Abortion Haven in the Mountain West Just Can't Get Enough?,"What if I told you there’s an island of abortion rights in the Mountain West, born of a state constitution so forward-looking that it started out by enshrining abortion rights a full year before the US Supreme Court’s landmark abortion decision Roe V. Wade in 1973? Hey from Montana, a strange, gigantic state that people have all kinds of ideas about. When I travel, which is often, telling someone I’m from Montana typically elicits one of two responses: The first is, “Oh, Trump Country!” I’ve had this one blurted at me from Mongolia to Michigan, no matter that Montana barely has a million people and almost no say in presidential electoral politics. The second tends along the lines of, “Oh I’m obsessed with Montana and I want to move there/vacation there/buy a fourth home there.” Okay. What I’ve never heard in response is anything about the strange political nuances of this place, or its wild history. Yes, my home state is admittedly, somewhat recently, deep “red,” with uber-conservative Republicans winning election to nearly every major office this year. But what’s also true is that with the fall of Roe in 2022, Montana has become a regional haven for abortion rights. Across much of the Mountain West, abortion rights are under attack and driving a wider loss of health-care options. Idaho in particular has enacted some of the most extreme anti-abortion laws in the country, driving out its own doctors and forcing its own residents to cross state lines for essential health care. But while anti-abortion Republicans swept political offices in Montana again this year, voters also overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment—one of eight states across the country seeking to protect abortion rights—further strengthening the power of pregnant people to make their own health-care decisions without political meddling. Fifty-eight percent of Montana voters supported the measure, the same percentage that voted for Donald Trump as president. It’s a puzzle how voters can elect candidates who work to overturn essential human rights, while voting for a measure to protect this one specific right. Montana clings to its identity as a place that, until recently, had made a big deal of living by the ethos of “do whatever the fuck you want, as long as it’s not harming someone else.” This spirit has been challenged repeatedly since the GOP took super-majority power in the state just a few years ago, leading to vicious attacks on trans Montanans, women, public education, and those seen as threats to the notion of a white, Christian cowboy landscape . But if you go back 50-plus years, things were very different in Montana. Labor unions held immense political power, as grassroots feminists and champions of citizen’s rights and environmental protection helped to write the state’s remarkably progressive constitution. Today those deep progressive political roots are proving stubborn and hard to plow under. In 1972, the League of Women Voters led a group writing a new state constitution. They agreed that privacy deserved a prime spot in the governing document, and as a result, article 2, section 10 of the Montana constitution reads, “The right of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.” There was never much mystery that the section was intended to protect the right to abortion as a medical decision. By setting down the “leave me alone” ethos in the constitution, Montana set itself apart. When the US Supreme Court two years ago ended Roe’s protections and set back human rights for women by decades, states across this region fell under immediate trigger laws—legislation established to ban abortion as soon as the high court made such a decision. Nowhere imposed more restrictive laws than Idaho, from attempting to hold doctors criminally liable for abortion services, to outright banning abortion at all stages of pregnancy. The result has been a mass outward departure from the state by doctors, especially OB-GYNs, and families who don’t want to raise children under laws that harken back to darker, even more dangerous times for women. Today, with the far-right-wing in charge of the state, attacks on abortion rights have quickened and been repeatedly struck down by state courts, leaning on those five-decade-old constitutional protections. Yes, Republicans took control of every statewide elected office, but they did so in part by concealing and obfuscating their plans to ban abortion, ignore the state constitution, and systematically attack the judicial branch that has stood in the way of unconstitutional abortion bans. And yet we again preserved the right to abortion, approved even in deep red counties. Maybe the old “leave us alone” ethos isn’t dead after all. Maybe it’s still lurking under the wave of disinformation and national political identity that has washed over us.. So when you look to red states, red counties, red regions, consider this. We have complex political histories and the Trump-era attacks on civil liberties that are washing over us now just might not be strong enough to erase where we came from. The women of Montana who fought to have our medical privacy protected decades ago likely saw this moment coming. Political extremism and disinformation are eroding our history and our rights, but our backbone isn’t yet broken.",,"['election', 'labor', 'legislation']",6.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.339924,5413
https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/05/07/80045377/uw-cries-antisemitism-in-wake-of-pro-palestine-protest,The Stranger (Web),UW Cries Antisemitism in Wake of Pro-Palestine Protest Just Can't Get Enough?,"On Monday, right before 5pm, dozens of masked people, several of whom were students, flocked to the University of Washington’s new Interdisciplinary Engineering Building (IEB). One group walked into the main entrance. Another group trotted down the stairs leading to the ground floor entrance. More went around the back. Vans and cars pulled up on E Stevens Way NE, stopped momentarily, and deposited more people and supplies such as bisected garbage cans-turned-shield and large metal sheets. Inside the 700,000-square-foot building’s glass walls, the new arrivals asked students and faculty to leave because they were taking over the building. As they left, informational flyers in hand, the protesters began to chain the IEB’s doors shut. The IEB cost UW $102 million. Ten million of that came from Boeing. For a century, Boeing has been one of UW’s top donors and the top employer of school alumni. In an April 2022 collaboration proposal between UW and Boeing, UW says that they will “work in close partnership with subject experts at Boeing to make sure the curriculum and research topics are highly relevant for top-priority challenges within the company.” And since 1948, Boeing has also been a key arms supplier to the Israel Defense Forces. The university’s relationship with Boeing is why these people had come to the IEB. For several hours on Monday, protesters affiliated with the Students United for Palestinian Equality and Return (SUPER) UW took over the IEB. They hung a sign renaming it the Sha’ban al-Dalou Building, honoring a Palestinian teenager slain by Israeli forces. In a press release, SUPER UW said they were “responding to the call” of the student movement in Gaza following the October 7 attacks in Israel, celebrating the way it “shattered the illusion of zionist-imperialist domination and brought Palestine to the forefront for all justice-loving people of the world.”“Our brothers and sisters in Gaza are living under a sky of constant US-funded rocket fire, while the zionist regime is continuing its land thefts and the torture and imprisonment of over 10,000 Palestinians who are facing lengthy sentences and unspeakable abuse,” the press release read. “Meanwhile, American and western institutions, like UW, continue to fund these atrocities and attempt to demonize the just struggle of the Palestinian people.” UW reported the protesters caused $1 million in damages, saying protesters spray painted messages like “Boeing Kills” on the walls, ripped a classroom door off its hinges, sealed doorways with epoxy glue, and smashed the glass doors housing specialized machinery that cost upwards of $100,000 a piece. (When reached for comment, Noah Weight, a student in SUPER UW, didn’t comment on the reported damage. Instead, he pointed to the group's mission. “Every single university [in Gaza] has been reduced to rubble,” Weight wrote, “but Western journalists, academics, and the public seem more concerned with damage done here, to a building that is intended to expand the scale of that destruction,” Weight wrote.) Late into Monday night, police in riot gear gathered. They faced off with protesters, and together with University of Washington Police, the Seattle Police Department arrested 32 protesters on Monday night for criminal trespass in the first degree, a misdemeanor. This marked the first significant pro-Palestine on-campus demonstration since Donald Trump took office and began targeting, detaining, and deporting international students involved in last spring’s protest encampments. Thanks to this administration, the landscape for protesting in general, and especially protesting against the war in Gaza, has changed. And our local responses show diverging paths: those who parrot the Trump administration’s propaganda, and those who resist it. This morning, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown released a statement about the damage to the school. He called the protest “disturbing,” and said that “it is clear that there was substantial damage to public property and threats to the overall safety of the university community.” He continued: “I am thankful that those responsible were arrested and, if found guilty, should be held accountable. I fully and always support people’s right to protest and to express their views. Indeed it is foundational to our democracy. But everyone has a right to be safe on campus and UW must enforce the law.” This is the kind of standard law and order statement you can expect from the powers that be when protests go down—especially when there's property damage in the mix. The university struck a different tone. After Monday’s building occupation, UW President Ana Mari Cauce sent an email to the UW community where she condemned the protest and said the university would “continue our actions to oppose antisemitism, racism and all forms of biases.” The official UW statement on the matter from UW spokesperson Victor Balta called the protest an “antisemitic statement” and said UW “will not be intimidated by this sort of offensive and destructive behavior and will continue to oppose antisemitism in all its forms.” Yesterday, in a press release, Trump’s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, a collaboration of some of the biggest idiots in our government (an Avengers assembly from hell of the Department of Education, Department of Health, and General Services Administration) weighed in on the situation, using their same tired rhetoric. U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon called the protest “yet another horrifying display of the antisemitic harassment and lawlessness which has characterized many of our nation’s elite campuses over the last several years,” and said it disrupted the lives of “Jewish students who live in fear on campus, of their equal opportunity protections and civil rights.” But the administration had a surprise for UW. Seattle is generally the Big Bad Radical Left in the Trump administration’s commentary, but yesterday, they broke that streak. The task force specifically commended UW’s “strong statement condemning [Monday] night’s violence.” Under a Trump administration that is already withholding research grant money, threatening funding over diversity and inclusion policies, and directly attacking universities like Harvard and Columbia, where prominent protests were held, the tenor of the University of Washington’s reaction to these protests has shifted. Echoing Trump administration talking points, faculty and administrators lambasted Monday’s demonstration as antisemitic. Last spring, when a pro-Palestine tent encampment sprung up in UW’s quad, UW’s tone was different. For three weeks, students and non-students gathered and refused to leave until the university cut ties with Israel and Boeing. It ended after UW agreed to increase transparency about its financial holdings and provide scholarships for displaced Palestinian students among other things. In her statement regarding the encampments, Cauce only referenced “vile rhetoric.” Now, “vile rhetoric” has become clear, actionable “antisemitism.” Alex Stonehill, the associate director of communication leadership at UW, rebuked the claims of antisemitism in these protests. “[Universities] are supposed to be these bastions of critical thought and critical inquiry about what’s happening,” Stonehill said. “When we see pretty baseless accusations of antisemitism on campus and when we don’t interrogate that and push back against it and try to figure out what’s actually happening, we’ve given up. It’s important to take a stand.” Student protesters such as Eric Horford believe in their movement, regardless of the higher stakes under the current administration. “We know the Trump administration is incredibly repressive,” Horford said. “But ultimately, regardless of whether it was Trump or Biden and Harris in office, the federal government has been incredibly anti-Palestinian and anti-student movement. The repression is always strong, and that's why we remain optimistic that no matter who we're up against, that our movement can stay strong and grow.” “We are demanding that Boeing and the influence of other companies that profit off of war be removed from our educational spaces here at UW,” Horford said. “We think it is shameful that after the developments of last year, they would continue and finish the construction of a building that's been invested in by Boeing.” But the situation is different for UW these days. They may not be as willing to appease protesters when they are busy appeasing a dictator. In the last month, the Trump administration has escalated its throwdown with the university system, specifically calling out the pro-Palestinian protests and anti-semitic, and calling on universities to quash them. In a letter sent to Harvard by the same clown brigade that ordered a review of UW, the administration claimed that “Harvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment.” And among other things, they demanded that the school report “individual faculty members who discriminated against Jewish or Israeli students or incited students to violate Harvard’s rules following October 7, and the University and federal government will cooperate to determine appropriate sanctions for those faculty members within the bounds of academic freedom and the First Amendment.” The letter lists the ways Harvard can get on its knees and win its federal funding back. When Harvard refused, Trump threatened not only its federal funding, but its tax-exempt status. And just yesterday, Columbia University announced layoffs of nearly 180 people after Trump cut $400 million of federal grant funding from the university, claiming that it “repeatedly fails to protect students from anti-Semitic harassment on campus.” UW would struggle to survive a similar attack. Funding has never been more tenuous for the university. It received around $2.1 billion in federal funds for research in 2024. To make matters financially worse, the proposed state budget trims state funds allocated to UW by over $166 million. And this has been piled on top of an already struggling university budget. Back during the 2008 recession, the state cut UW’s per-student funding by half. The funding has yet to recover to where it was before 2008. According to UW Magazine, the state funded UW the same amount in 2019 as it did in 1990. Can a cash-strapped university still stay true to its values under the Trump administration? Universities have the potential to be an essential tool in standing up to dictators. UW prides itself on “being boundless,” except maybe boundlessness is limited by who holds the capital. In the 15 years Stonehill has worked at UW, he’s seen the public service mission eroded due to the loss of federal and state funding. “The university had to move more towards corporate funding and wealthy philanthropists to make things happen here,” Stonehill said. “What we're seeing now is the downside of that. Corporations like Boeing are making weapons that are being used to kill people, and we can't say anything about it because we’re reliant on their money. I’d really like for that to change.” Editor’s Note: This story has been updated to reflect new documentation that shows a collaboration proposal between Boeing and the University of Washington.

https://www.thestranger.com/queer/2024/12/16/79827634/the-first-trans-rights-case-of-the-next-trump-era,The Stranger (Web),The First Trans Rights Case of the Next Trump Era Just Can't Get Enough?,"There is a widespread political fantasy that transgender people are so central to American life that they swayed the outcome of a US Presidential election and turned millions into authoritarian apologists. The most obsessive rightwingers believe trans people control American universities, corporations and language itself, justifying the more than 1,000 bills to restrict trans health care and civil rights as retribution for an imagined social hijacking. Earlier this month, one of those bills from Tennessee, SB1, came before the Supreme Court. And next June, the Justices will determine whether the law violates the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection clause. US v. Skrmetti is the first case before the court to directly consider this question for trans youth, but it's not as straightforward as determining if this law discriminates against them. SB1, passed in March 2023, prohibits doctors from prescribing trans children puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), or gender-affirming surgery, while allowing those same treatments for intersex children, children starting puberty early or late, and medical conditions other than gender dysphoria. The state argued it had a compelling interest in “encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty.” The petitioners—trans children, their parents, their doctors, the American Civil Liberties Union and the federal government—contend transgender people fall into a quasi-suspect class. They allege the state ignored the proven benefits of gender-affirming care and that the law itself is making a distinction on the basis of those who “appreciate” and disdain their sex. A lower district court sided with them, and granted a preliminary injunction temporarily preventing the law from taking effect. The conservative Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision, and an appeal brought the case before the court last Wednesday. The most important question the Justices must answer is what the “standard of review” should be in this case, a legal term for how skeptical courts should be when evaluating laws that treat and classify groups differently. Tennessee draws the line between kids who take hormones and puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria and those prescribed the same drugs for reasons including early puberty and intersex conditions. Imara Jones, creator of the nonprofit multimedia publication Translash, was in the courtroom last Wednesday. Not one to sugarcoat, she still emerged hopeful. “Every time they tested various arguments, they quickly realized they were in a cul-de-sac that always brought them back to sex,” she says. “And I think it reinforced the main argument from the Solicitor General and ACLU.” Choosing the Arena Courts evaluate Equal Protection cases on three levels of judicial scrutiny: “Suspect,” or strict scrutiny for cases involving race, religion, national origin, and lack of citizenship, “quasi-suspect” or middle-tier scrutiny in gender and sex-based cases, and “rational basis” or minimum scrutiny, when no “suspect” class applies. The higher the level of scrutiny, the more a government must do to prove its law is both necessary and in the interest of the state. Conversely, under “rational basis” review, a state just needs to prove the government’s action is rationally related to a legitimate interest. That’s the reason this question of “tier” matters. Under heightened scrutiny, Tennessee has more to prove, and their body of evidence is lacking. Tennessee argues SB1 does not make a sex classification; instead, they argue, they’re making an age distinction unrelated to sex. Earlier this month, Justice Samuel Alito seemed swayed by this argument, recalling his statements in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the 2022 case that overturned Roe v. Wade, and the 1974 case, Geduldig v. Aiello, which found that states could regulate medical procedures related to biological sex. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, the official who represents the federal government before the Supreme Court, held that while those cases only implicated sex, Tennessee’s law made explicit distinctions. “That doesn’t apply in any relevant respect here,” she said. “These aren’t drugs that are limited to one sex or another. Both males and females alike have been prescribed puberty blockers, hormones, testosterone, estrogen. They produce the same physical characteristics … no matter if your sex is male or female.” Elana Redfield is a Federal Policy Director at the Williams Institute, a LGBTQ public-policy research center at the University of California, Los Angeles. She says Prelogar’s point could potentially resonate with Justice Neil Gorsuch. But it’s hard to know for sure. The normally chatty justice didn’t ask a single question during oral arguments. There’s hope for a repeat of the unexpected 5-4 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, the first and only Supreme Court case to consider transgender rights, where Gorsuch sided with the liberals and authored a majority opinion about employment discrimination that grounded trans-friendly policy in Joe Biden’s federal agencies. “An individual’s homosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to employment decisions,” he wrote. “That’s because it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.” However, Bostock can’t be treated as a bellwether: Skrmetti is not a Title VII case; The court that delivered the narrow ruling on employment discrimination is a shade redder than it was in 2019; And Gorsuch has not tucked a trans flag under his robes. In Bostock, Gorsuch addressed employers worried the court’s decision would sweep “beyond Title VII to other federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination,” including sex-segregated bathrooms, locker rooms and dress codes. “But none of those other laws are before us today,” he wrote. That limited ruling frees Gorsuch and the rest of the conservative bench to rule differently here. Whatever Gorsuch comes to will be rigid and textualist. While his logic in past cases would suggest applying heightened scrutiny, there’s no evidence he is sympathetic to the petitioners. Meanwhile, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed the unlikely possibility of creating a new suspect class for trans people, but said to her knowledge, before the laws of the last three years, and Trump’s military ban during his first term, there was no history of discrimination under government-enacted laws. But modern concepts of transness do not always apply to a historical framework. Chase Strangio, a staff attorney at the ACLU and the first trans person to argue before the Supreme Court, mentioned a history of laws forbidding cross dressing, and a number of old statutes that lumped gay and trans people together. Even recent historical figures from early in the gay rights movement we’d think of as transgender today wouldn’t have described themselves as such. Even if the evidence of de jure discrimination convinces Barrett, a new suspect class has not been named in decades. It’s unlikely she’d rule in favor of creating it. The 1 Percent D Dangaran, a board member of the National Trans Bar Association, has faith that the court will apply intermediate scrutiny in this case, but worries the conservative Justices will throw their weight behind the argument that gender-affirming care harms people who later detransition, which Justice Kavanugh didn’t think the court could ignore. Children and adults who seek trans healthcare want trans healthcare, and study after study shows it improves their general well-being. For this reason, few change their minds. However, detransition is a real, and deeply personal experience the right misrepresents as a singular political argument against trans healthcare. While a small percentage of people detransition because they regret taking hormones or undergoing surgery, many stop transitioning because they lack social support, simply experience a shift in their self-conception, or are pausing before re-transitioning later. The right—and a minority of vocal detrans people who claim to speak for the community—have worked to draw a false equivalence between their experiences and the experiences of many more people who benefit from trans care (gender-affirming surgeries, for example, have extremely low regret rates of about 1%.) Republicans have not scrambled to ban similar procedures such as elective, risk-reducing mastectomies for cis people, although regret rates are five to 14 times higher, or breast augmentations, which between 5% and 9% of patients regret, according to a literature review in the peer-reviewed American Journal of Surgery. The same study found regret rates for body contouring dance between 10% and 33%. Other studies show up to 30% of patients regret knee surgeries and prostatectomies. About 19% of people regret bariatric surgery for weight loss. But here we are: Supreme Court justices and the journalists sculpting their views are circling the wagons over a 1% regret rate. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti has gone as far to say that the medical consensus on gender affirming care is “fake.” None of them are doctors, so it’s not surprising they’d take medical information out of context. Anti-trans bills reinforce this bias by making it easier for former patients to sue doctors who provided gender-affirming care. What is it about this small risk that induces the urge to slam the brakes on medical care that works for the vast majority of people who receive it? The news media seem to see the narratives around abortion regret, a real experience, as the anti-abortion propaganda that it is. Mainstream news organizations are not devoting limited resources to investigate how those experiences might inform the legitimacy of a procedure that has medical consensus. But many do spend an unusual amount of time and effort questioning gender-affirming care. The specter of gender regret haunts differently. Ironically, the focus suggests living in a body intolerably marred by gendered characteristics is a unique horror. The very thing gender-affirming care seeks to remedy. “When the facts are truly weighed, that should not be an exceedingly persuasive justification for this broad categorical ban that covers both those who want it, and that small percentage of people who may actually feel harmed by the care they receive,” Dangaran said. Similarly, Tennessee is relying on bunk scientific claims to discredit gender affirming care that would crumple under examination. Totally circumventing questions about suspect classes and equal protection, Kavanaugh argued that it’s not the court’s job to evaluate the evidence or resolve medical and policy questions. (As Strangio pointed out, the court didn’t hesitate to apply heightened scrutiny in a case involving medical judgements when it ruled churches’s right to freely practice religion superseded the public health risk of spreading COVID-19 at large gatherings.) The Swing(ish) Votes Justices Alito, Clarence Thomas, Kavanaugh, and Chief Justice John Roberts seemed most sympathetic to Tennessee's arguments, while questions from Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson indicated they saw the connection between the precedent established in Bostock, and the dangerous precedent the court could set in this case. Brown Jackson noted a parallel to the “scientific” arguments made in Loving v. Virginia, in which the court evaluated if Virginia’s “anti-miscegenation” laws banning interracial marriage had any rational basis. If the court approaches this case by saying “there are lots of good reasons for this policy and who are we as the Court to say otherwise,” Jackson said, “I'm worried that we're undermining the foundations of some of our bedrock equal protection cases.” Barrett and Gorsuch are the wildcards, and only one has to side with the conservatives for majority. This could come down to an ideological decision that sides with the state over the precedent of sex discrimination and what many would see as an objective reading of the Constitution. The court could conservatively kick it back to the lower court, or determine the reasoning in Bostock applies. That would be strong support for liberal interpretations of Section 1557, the Affordable Care Act’s anti-discrimination statute, cases on sports and other cases on gender-affirming care. Those cases are coming. A victory for the petitioners in this case would be narrow at best, and nobody should expect Obergefell, when people married hours after the decision ran down the courthouse steps. These laws are scattershot across the country, with different technicalities built into each one. Twenty-six states have restricted gender-affirming care for minors. While most are roughly similar to Tennessee, and this case has the potential to invalidate them, there are other ways of limiting care, like cutting funding and increasing liability. On the other hand, the petitioners did not take up a number of other related legal claims, including a parent’s right to choose the best care for their child and first amendment claims.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2024/12/13/79822766/state-rep-cyndy-jacobsens-early-christmas-present-for-trans-people,The Stranger (Web),State Rep. Cyndy Jacobsen’s Early Christmas Present for Trans People Just Can't Get Enough?,"State Rep. Cyndy Jacobsen’s House Bill 1038 to ban gender-affirming care for kids and House Bill 1027 to keep trans inmates convicted of a sex offenses out of gender-affirming housing, will die on the vine, just like they did last year. As I wrote in this grave-dancing report in February, a “Don’t Say Gay” copycat from State Sen. Phil Fortunato and State Sen. Mike Padden’s bill to force deadnaming in schools—inspired by the lovely folks at the anti-LGBTQ Heritage Foundation—didn’t even get Senate hearings. Neither did three House bills, including “The Protecting Children’s Bodies Act,” banning gender-affirming procedures and punishing doctors who performed them, and two Jacobsen-sponsored bills (HB 2241 and HB 1233) that were identical to the two she pre-filed this Tuesday and Wednesday. Third time’s the charmless? With that flawless record, it’s likely that every lawmaker in the Legislature knows that these bills will not become law. But they will rile up the conservative base, and keep the conversation alive and draw new converts. House Bill 1038 HB 1038 prohibits puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy, and gender-affirming surgeries for minors, while still allowing doctors to perform the same treatments on intersex children with “medically verifiable disorders of sex development” born with bodies that are not conventionally male or female. For the umpteenth time—the requisite paragraph—this evidence-based care is not fringe or experimental medicine. It’s supported by every major medical organization in the United States for its documented benefits for a child’s overall health and well-being and doctors who know more than you and me. Moreover, it may seem counterintuitive, but banning gender-affirming care for trans kids and allowing doctors to perform the same procedures on intersex children to “fix” a person’s gender serves the same goals of restricting bodily autonomy, and normalizing gender as much as possible, regardless of a person’s feelings on the matter or the consequences. Even the meaning of “irreversible changes” depends on how or why a drug or a knife alters the human body. So do the rights of parents, apparently, as gender-affirming care for youth generally does not exist in Washington without the consent of a legal parent or guardian. Like gender, sex lies on a biological spectrum, and while intersex people are common as redheads, making up about 1.7% of the population, many conditions are invisible even to people born with them. Someone can go a whole life without themselves or anyone else knowing that chromosomally, they are not strictly male or female, or that an intersexual difference explains that persistent hormonal imbalance. It’s not uncommon for intersex people to identify as trans or nonbinary if they don’t identify with the gender they were raised as, but it’s not a given. They’re distinct identities and experiences. A smaller number are born with genitalia that aren’t conventionally male or female, either. Historically, doctors have convinced parents that to dodge a life of stigma, they should surgically “correct” children so young they couldn’t possibly know or consent to what’s being done to them. Doctors have also lied to teens and young adults about the medical necessity of these treatments. In 2017, Human Rights Watch published a report on the irreversible damage and trauma from intersex surgeries in the US. “The results are often catastrophic, the supposed benefits are largely unproven, and there are generally no urgent health considerations at stake.” In the past decade or so, intersex activists have successfully pushed doctors and hospitals to leave these decisions to intersex people themselves, and to stop performing unnecessary procedures. In 2017, the American Academy of Family Physicians condemned such procedures, and in 2020, Lurie Children’s Hospital in Chicago became the first to publicly apologize for harming intersex people. Doctors can responsibly, and consensually, provide hormones and perform surgery on intersex people, sometimes for medically necessary reasons. Jacobsen’s bill does not make that distinction, and that’s common in bans on gender-affirming care for youth. House Bill 1027 HB 1027 bans the Washington Department of Corrections from placing trans inmates in gender-affirming housing if they’ve been convicted of a sex offense against someone of the same gender. So trans women who’ve sexually assaulted cis women would be kept in men’s prisons, and trans men who’ve sexually assaulted cis men would be put into women’s prisons. Last year, Rep. Jacobsen told conservative radio host Jason Rantz that her bill protects women and people who’ve committed sex crimes, and doesn’t “reference anyone, transgender anything,” but the law couldn’t apply to anyone else. People who’ve committed sex crimes sometimes go to state prison. But states don’t assign women into men’s prisons, and men in women’s prisons, if they’ve sexually assaulted someone of the same gender as a preventative measure. That would be ridiculous. Then the only way to interpret the bill is it views trans women as men and trans men as women, and puts them right where they belong by applying a new standard to trans people over “reasonable safety concerns,” which everyone knows is shorthand for penis and a record. Obviously, trans women can have vaginas, but they too would be sent to a men’s prison if they’d been convicted of a sex crime. Sex crimes are just what this bill would likely facilitate, rather than prevent. Outside of prison, trans people are four times more likely to experience violent victimization, including rape, sexual assault and aggravated assault, according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law. That trend is worse inside. The 2015 National Inmate Survey from the Bureau of Justice Statistics found trans inmates were nine times more likely to be sexually harassed and assaulted within a year of their arrival. Thirty-five percent of trans people in prison and 34 percent in jails were sexually assaulted by staff or inmates. The 2015 US Trans Survey, the largest dataset on trans people in the US currently available, found trans inmates were five times more likely to be assaulted by facility staff than the average prisoner and over nine times more likely to be sexually assaulted by other inmates. While the US Supreme Court ruled in 1994 that failing to protect trans people in custody is unconstitutional, it’s still common practice to jail trans women with men and trans men with women. Americans value the innocents. We don’t care much for the rights of criminals. If we did, I don’t think we’d lock up a fourth of the world’s incarcerated people, or feel content disenfranchising them or exploiting their labor in prison. But guilt is not an excuse to make someone suffer. Working the Base Rep. Jacobsen likely knows her bills aren’t going anywhere. She did not respond to a request for comment, but when she introduced her gender-affirming last year, she said in a press release that her bill would start a conversation, hearing or no hearing. It usually does. Any bill to restrict the rights of trans people generates buzz on local conservative media about out of control wokeness, and the lack of common sense from Democrats running Washington State like an insane asylum. Or something like that.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/06/20/80109593/what-the-scotus-decision-on-trans-care-means-for-washington,The Stranger (Web),What the SCOTUS Decision on Trans Care Means for Washington Just Can't Get Enough?,"The Supreme Court upheld Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery for anyone under 18. What does that mean? The impact of this case, US v. Skrmetti, will have a tremendous impact on trans kids and their families living in the 27 states that have banned trans care in some way. Families with the means are likely to move to states where this medical care is legal. Those who can’t afford it may have no choice but to stay. The implications are serious. It’s not good by any stretch of the imagination, but the ruling itself is narrow, legal experts and advocates say. Protective laws in states like Washington are not “directly” affected by this decision, legal and policy experts say. This decision tells us nothing about other laws that discriminate against transgender people on the basis of sex, or how the Court is going to characterize those other laws. It also doesn’t tell us how the Court would rule in a case where it’s clear the law is motivated by animus, or hatred, a question before the courts in other trans rights cases. Some Necessary Legalese The question before the Court in US v. Skrmetti was whether Tennessee’s ban, SB1, violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. When a court is evaluating if a law like Tennessee's violates this clause, it must decide if it distinguishes between people on the basis of a protected characteristic such as race or sex. Different characteristics are given different levels of judicial “scrutiny.” The higher the level of scrutiny, the more a government must do to prove its law is in the necessary interest of the state, several legal experts told The Stranger. “Suspect” cases that involve race, religion, national origin and lack of citizenship are held to the highest level of scrutiny. “Quasi-suspect” cases on sex and gender are in the middle. “Rational bias,” applied when there is no suspect class, is the lowest bar of judicial review. It takes very little to survive rational basis review. All a government like Tennessee’s has to prove is that its law is “rationally” related to a legitimate interest like regulating health care, which is exactly what happened in Skrmetti. The Court ruled that Tennessee’s ban, which allows cisgender and intersex kids to get the same hormonal and surgical treatments for different medical reasons, did not violate the Equal Protection Clause because the law did not discriminate against transgender people’s gender or sex. It discriminated against their age and medical diagnosis, which are not protected characteristics. “This case carries with it the weight of fierce scientific and policy debates about the safety, efficacy, and propriety of medical treatments in an evolving field. The voices in these debates raise sincere concerns; the implications for all are profound,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. “The Equal Protection Clause does not resolve these disagreements. Nor does it afford us license to decide them as we see best.” It’s tortured logic. There’s nothing fierce about the “debate” over trans medicine, which is neither new nor experimental. There are voices raising “concerns,” but they don’t carry the same weight as the scientific consensus that these treatments are safe and effective. The myth that trans youth are rushed into hormones and surgery has no basis in fact. Consider that Tennessee's one dedicated gender clinic for kids performed about five top surgeries a year before Republicans pressured it to pause all surgeries in 2022. The Justices voted along ideological lines. In her dissent, liberal Justice Sonya Sotomayor wrote the Court retreated from judicial review where it mattered most. What Does This Mean For Other Cases? Like the Dobbs decision on abortion, the Court has punted decisions about trans care for kids to the state legislatures, which has devastated trans people in red states. But the decision doesn’t kill protective laws in blue states like Washington or prevent lawmakers from strengthening those protections. It’s likely that opponents of trans care will argue the Skrmetti decision allows them to enact new laws without triggering heightened scrutiny, but an important legal question remains open, says Elana Redfield, Federal Policy Director at the Williams Institute, a think tank at University of California, Los Angeles School of Law that researches LGBTQ people. “The Court notably, quite significantly, didn’t decide whether transgender status merits higher scrutiny, because in this case, they found the classification wasn’t based on transgender status,” she says. “Even though we saw some inklings from various members of the court as to how they might rule on the issue—its full factual development has not yet been presented to the Court.” In fact, the Court noted repeatedly that it did not feel that intentional discrimination was raised in this case, which was striking, Redfield says. Discrimination was a big part of oral arguments, even if the Justices were ignorant of that discrimination. At one point, when Justice Amy Coney Barrett raised the possibility of creating a new “suspect” class for transgender people, she said she was unaware of any history of laws targeting transgender people before the military ban during Trump’s first term. ACLU Attorney Chase Strangio responded by reciting some of that history, including laws criminalizing cross-dressing and old statutes that threw gay and trans people into the same group. “It seemed pretty clear that the parties were arguing that these bans were a form of discrimination,” she says. “It felt to me like a core component of the argument being made by both the US and the plaintiffs.” Basically, if the court felt that wasn’t argued, the Equal Protection argument remains on the table for other trans medical cases, or for issues like sports and identification documents. There’s also the argument that even under rational basis, the law is motivated by a discriminatory animosity toward trans people. There’s also the matter of President Donald Trump’s Executive Order to ban all forms of gender-affirming care for people under 19, which Washington, Oregon, and Minnesota are now fighting in federal court. Equal Protection is part of their case—not under the 14th Amendment, but Equal Protection in due process under the 5th Amendment—but so is federal overreach. The lawsuit argues Trump doesn’t have the power to criminalize medical practices in Washington or enact funding restrictions over Congress’s head. “The actual holding of the case really says nothing about the many other issues at play in the many other cases challenging the Trump administration’s assault on trans people and their humanity,” says Vanessa Hernandez, Integrated Advocacy Director at the ACLU of Washington. What Does This Mean for Washington? The decision does not directly affect Washington’s laws. In this state, transgender people are protected under the Washington Law Against Discrimination and the Gender Affirming Treatment Act, which requires health insurers in this state to cover any and all trans care from surgery to laser hair removal. Transgender people are already moving to flee discriminatory laws in red states. Danni Askini, Executive Director of the Seattle trans advocacy organization Gender Justice League, says about 2,000 of them have reached out to her organization for support in the last year. The state can expect more kids and their families to come from states with bans like Idaho, Montana, Utah and Wyoming. There are questions as to whether our healthcare infrastructure can handle that influx of new patients, or what other tricks the federal government has up its sleeves. Anecdotally, advocates say we’re far from a crisis point, but they have heard of longer wait times to see doctors. A recent Williams Institute study that analyzed data from 133 gender-affirming care providers in states without care bans found that more than half reported more demand from children and adults due to recent legislation. They reported seeing hundreds of out-of-state patients. While most reported short waitlists, some were staggeringly long: 4 percent said over 300 people were waiting for an appointment. Askini, who co-teaches a class on gender-affirming care at University of Washington School of Medicine, says many hospital systems in the area are working to train residents on trans care and expand continuing education for doctors. But even Askini hasn’t been able to reestablish gender-affirming care since moving back to Washington three months ago. “I’m scrounging my last [hormone] patches, cutting them in half, stretching them out, because it’s really hard to find a gender-affirming primary care physician,” she says. “I’m one of the most known trans activists in Washington state and even I can’t get primary healthcare.” Gender Justice League recently issued a call for trans people to stockpile their hormones. It has serious concerns about access, given the federal government’s aggressive stance on trans people generally.. “I don’t think there’s reason to panic,” Askini says. “I think the biggest concern that I have is this opens the door and emboldens our opposition to try and pass an adult ban.” Jaelynn Scott, Executive Director of Lavender Rights Project, which provides services to Black and Indigenous trans people, is concerned about the continued threats to federal funding putting indirect pressure on hospitals to “chip at the wall” of gender-affirming care, she says. Seattle Children’s, an enormous research institution that depends on millions in federal grants, has already flipflopped on offering transgender surgery for youth since Trump took office. “The recommendation from our organization is to lean into leadership and not panic,” Scott says. “We are very privileged here with an attorney general and a governor and a state that is supportive of our communities—and we need to be leading the way on how to resist. Instead of panicking, we need people to go into action and to start paying attention to their siblings in other states who will be facing immediate loss of access to care.”",,"['infrastructure', 'policy', 'development', 'legislation']",5.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.302089,10146

Just Can't Get Enough?,"Seattle, you’re terrible at voting in special elections. According to the county’s website, in the April 2023 Special Election, nearly 1.4 million voters were registered in King County, but a measly 30.86 percent returned their ballots. Yikes! (Compare that to the 81 percent of King County’s registered voters who participated in the November General Election.) This year, our Special Election is in February (tomorrow!), and it’s an important one. Both social housing and money for schools are on the ballot. But as of this morning, only 16 percent of registered voters in King County have returned their ballots. We have to do better! And yes, I say “we” because, admittedly, I am part of that lazy/tired/busy 84 percent who have yet to vote. My ballot is also just sitting right here, unopened and unloved. Let’s change that together! To brush up on what’s on the ballot, check out our February 2025 Special Election Voting Guide. Just wanna skip to the answers? Cool. For Propositions Nos 1A and 1B first vote YES, and then vote for Proposition 1A. We explain why in our endorsement, but for even more information on why you should support 1A, read about what we found when we dug into the contribution records. It turns out a lot of rich, non-Seattle folks and Amazon are pushing really hard for 1B. Always suspicious! For schools, vote yes on both Proposition 1 and Proposition 2. Money for schools!—even if you’re grumpy about the whole school-closures debacle. Kids still have to show up in those buildings every day; we don’t give them a choice. You have until 8 pm tomorrow to slip your ballot into one of the many ballot boxes around town (find your closest option here)! (While you can generally send it in by mail, it’s a little late in the game to guarantee it’d be postmarked in time—dropping it in a ballot box is your best bet at this point.) Not registered? There’s still time to do that, too! You can register and vote in person on election day at the King County Elections Office.",,"['election', 'housing']",5.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.332745,2002

You will need to log in if you are not already. Why does seattletimes.com have comments? We want the stories, visuals, columns and editorials we publish to be a starting point for conversation, not a dead end. The goal of commenting is to maintain a civil space where people who live in or care about the Pacific Northwest can have meaningful, informed conversations about the facts presented in The Seattle Times. How do I report a comment that breaks the rules? Bring it to our attention by clicking on the ""report"" link that appears with each comment. We will review it as soon as possible (at times there could be a delay of a few hours). Who reviews the reported comments? The Seattle Times' digital audience team and other staff in the newsroom. As a Seattle Times subscriber, can I still be suspended or banned from commenting? Yes, the Code of Conduct applies to all users, regardless of subscription status. If you violate the Code of Conduct, your commenting privileges may be suspended or revoked, but you will still be able to read articles. Will you tell me when I’ve been suspended or banned? Will you tell me why? And can I be reinstated? If you are suspended or banned from commenting, we will notify you via the email address associated with your commenting account. The first violation of the Code of Conduct results in a 24-hour suspension -- essentially, a warning. If you break the rules again after that, you'll be banned. Bans are permanent. Why are you censoring peoples’ opinions? The Seattle Times reserves the right to allow or disallow any kind of content that doesn't meet its standards as outlined in the Code of Conduct, Terms of Service and this FAQ. The Times is under no obligation to publish every comment it receives. Generally, a comment is removed not because of the opinion it expresses but because it violates those basic rules. What about my right to free speech? The right to free speech described in the First Amendment concerns the relationship between the U.S. government and its citizens. Any private business can require certain standards of conduct, as we do with our Code of Conduct. Why can’t I comment on wire stories? As of May 15, 2017, The Seattle Times is not accepting reader comments on news stories originating with The Associated Press, The New York Times, The Washington Post, Bloomberg and other wire services. The intent is to focus our newsroom's time and energy on discussions related to news stories covered by our staff, and foster constructive conversation around local news and issues. Why don’t you make commenters use real names? We have considered requiring real names, and decided not to for a few reasons. First, we don't have the resources to independently verify that names used by commenters are indeed real. Some sites have tried to get around this by connecting comments to Facebook profiles. But Facebook's verification mechanisms are imperfect as well, and not everyone has a Facebook profile. We think you shouldn't have to join another site to have conversations on ours. Plus, our commenting vendor — unlike Facebook — keeps users’ data private. Another reason for not requiring real names: Research on commenting communities shows that using real names doesn't actually compel people to act more civilly toward each other. Comments on Facebook posts offer countless examples of this. There's also evidence that, when commenters are all using their real names, people with names that suggest they're women or people of color are more likely to be harassed, and we don't want to invite those kinds of attacks into our community. The folks who built our commenting tool published an enlightening piece on this subject; we invite you to read it. What is the ""respect"" link for? This allows you to convey respect for a particularly thoughtful, well-reasoned contribution from a fellow reader. You may use it once per comment. Why don’t you pre-screen all of the comments? We do actively moderate and pre-screen comments on some stories when there's a high likelihood the discussion will stray off topic. But we don't have the staff resources to read and approve every comment on our site before it is posted. That's why we provide readers the tools to help us keep the conversation civil through the ""report"" and ""respect"" links. We encourage readers to report comments that violate the Code of Conduct. Why do you require a subscription in order to comment? We made this decision based on the amount of time necessary to moderate comments that violate our code of conduct. It helps keep spam out of the comments. It allows us to better control the legitimacy of commenters. And adding the step of having to be subscribed and logged in deters the hit-and-run troll. Can I change the way I view the comments? Yes. By default, you'll see featured comments first. If no comments have been featured on that thread yet, you'll see all the comments chronologically beginning with the newest first. At the top of each comment thread (above the first comment), you'll see options to sort the comments in other ways. Can I see another user's commenting history? No. However, you can see your own commenting history, and you can see how long someone has been a member of the commenting community. Can I edit or remove a comment after I've posted it? You have the option to edit a comment for up to 5 minutes after you post it. But you cannot remove a comment, so please be absolutely sure you want to make such a comment publicly. Comments are indexed by search engines, and they also could remain on our site for many years. Why do comments close 72 hours after an article is published? You can still read others' thoughts after 72 hours, but indeed will not be able to contribute your own. Limiting commenting on old stories keeps our moderators focused on the stories that have the most readers at the time. Why do old stories not have comment threads anymore? We changed commenting systems in April 2019. Unfortunately, issues with technology, different vendors and resources kept us from being able to preserve old comments when we made this change. What are some other ways to share my thoughts on news stories and topics of the day? If you'd like to give input on issues raised in an article, and that article doesn't have a comment thread, you've still got several other opportunities. Here are a few of them: The Seattle Times’ commenting community is a civil space where people who live in or otherwise care about the Pacific Northwest can have meaningful, informed conversations about the facts presented in The Times. Our newsroom strives to reflect the vibrancy and diversity of the region and tell the story of its continuing transformation. We aim to be a model of innovative, audience-supported regional journalism, to strengthen democracy, build community, encourage constructive discourse and enrich people’s lives. Seattle Times staff retains the prerogative to determine what is published on seattletimes.com. To that end, just as we hold our journalism to high ethical standards, we hold comments published alongside our work to high ethical standards. This is a living document. We expect to revise these guidelines in response to community feedback and behavior. Tips for constructive commenting Our commenters represent a variety of identities, perspectives and life experiences, which inform the well-reasoned opinions they share with their neighbors on our site. Here’s how you can help us foster an inclusive, respectful environment for everyone who visits or participates in the comments: Unacceptable behavior If your comment reflects any of the following, it will be removed and you may be suspended from commenting on seattletimes.com. If you violate this code of conduct repeatedly, you will be permanently banned. Seattle Times staff retain sole discretion to moderate, suspend or ban anyone whose behavior we determine to be a detriment to the atmosphere of our site. We will take into account both individual comments and a commenter’s past behavior when making these decisions. More information about how commenting works Comments containing links to sites that do not conform to these guidelines will also be removed. In some cases, we might pre-moderate comments containing links. If a comment is removed, all replies to that comment are hidden. Decisions to remove a comment, or to suspend a user, are final. A user who has been banned may appeal to customercare@seattletimes.com to request the ban be changed to a suspension at our staff’s discretion. A user may make only one such appeal; there are no third chances. Stories from wire services, such as The Associated Press or New York Times, do not have comment threads. We are focusing our limited staff time on discussions around stories produced by The Seattle Times. Comment threads automatically close to new submissions 72 hours after an article is published. Seattle Times staff may also use our discretion to close comments on an article at any time for a variety of ethical and/or practical reasons. Talk to us If you have questions about anything related to our commenting community, please email customercare@seattletimes.com. Commenting isn’t the only way to share your thoughts about the news. Reporters’ contact information is listed on their articles so you can reach out to them directly. You can also submit a letter or Op-Ed about a local topic to be considered for publication in the Opinion section. Q: Where do I send comments or requests about newspaper home delivery?

Letters to the editor are an important part of the Opinion section. Our readers share a wide range of perspectives on current issues. Letters that are well-written, have a clear opinion, are responsive to current events and keep to the word count are more likely to be chosen for publication. We always try to give preference to The Seattle Times’ critics in choosing letters to be published. Opinions that differ from those presented elsewhere on the editorial and Opinion pages are also given priority. The Times also seeks to publish letters from a range of readers of diverse backgrounds with priority given to those in Washington state. Letters should be 200 words or fewer. When submitting a letter, please include the topic or headline and date of The Seattle Times article, editorial or opinion piece to which your letter refers. You may mail or email your letter, and all letters must include your full name (no initials), address and telephone number for verification. Your residential address and personal phone number, used for verification purposes, will not be published. Your name and city of residence are published as a letter’s signature. We do not publish letters written anonymously or under pseudonyms. Please do not expect us to publish letters from a single writer more frequently than once every three months to give other readers a chance to express their opinions. If your letter is selected for publication, you may be contacted for identity verification or if we have questions about its content. Letters become the property of The Seattle Times and may be edited. Email to: letters@seattletimes.com Writing guidelines: Do’s and Don’ts DO: Have an opinion and state it forcefully — Many letters submitted are explanations of an issue or a restatement of a news article, rather than knowledgeable arguments about an issue. Those won’t make the cut. DO: Be civil and constructive — It’s perfectly appropriate to strongly criticize ideas, reasoning or positions that you disagree with. But it is not appropriate to make personal attacks. DO: Be timely — We prefer letters about current events rather than something that happened months ago. Address issues covered by The Times in recent weeks. Make sure a letter submission contains the most recent updates on a news topic. DO: Cite sources and provide context — Please include URLs for statistics, facts and reports mentioned in your letter submission. This helps the editor fact-check letters. DO: Submit a letter only to The Seattle Times — If your letter has been sent to another publication or published elsewhere in print, on a personal blog or on Facebook, we will not be able to use it. DO: Submit as text — Please include the text of the submission in the body of the email or in an attached Microsoft Word document. Please do not send us files in PDF format. DON’T: Send a PR pitch or send a letter as part of a campaign — Don’t submit a letter related to your organization’s event or as part of a letter campaign. News tips should be sent to newstips@seattletimes.com. DON’T: Demand a letter be removed once it is published — The Times does not remove content online once it has been published. If something needs correcting, please follow up with an email to letters@seattletimes.com. Contact the letters editor Letters editor Agnes Torres Al-Shibibi can be reached at aalshibibi@seattletimes.com The Seattle Times welcomes guest opinion submissions. We receive dozens of essays a week but usually can publish just one op-ed per day. To be considered, a submission should offer a strong opinion and be no more than 650 words. If you do not hear from us within FIVE business days, it's likely we will not be publishing your submission. Due to the volume of submissions we receive, we can't reply to each pitch, even though we'd like to! An opinion essay is for making arguments or comments on public policy or issues in the news. It is not a place for organizations or agencies merely to report on programs, or for outlining the history of an issue and failing to take a side. We give highest priority to local writers writing about Northwest topics. In most cases we will not run Op-Eds from candidates running for office. We require first-publication rights, for print and online, to all of our submissions. If your essay has been published elsewhere in print or online, including on social media, or has been presented as testimony in a public setting, such as a hearing, we will not be able to use it. When we use a freelance article from you, you retain ownership of any copyright to the article and the right to resell it, subject to our right to edit, publish, republish and reproduce the article in publications and reprints of The Seattle Times Company and its subsidiaries and affiliates. This includes non-exclusive rights to use the article, in whole or in part, in electronic media, including searchable databases and electronic publications in any form and medium, which may include commercial database services where your work may be individually accessed. Where to Send Please send your submission by email: oped@seattletimes.com Please include the text of the submission in the body of the email. Don't send it as a PDF or Word attachment. Don't send a link to another program, like a Google doc; we will not open unsolicited links. We do not publish guest essays written anonymously or under pseudonyms. Nor should writers have any direct financial ties to the subject of the essay. If there could be any question, please disclose that up front. We do not pay for submissions. Please include a biography of 30 words or fewer. Please include URLs for statistics, facts and reports mentioned in your guest essay. Writing guidelines: Do's and Don'ts for Op-ed Writers DO have an opinion and state it forcefully. Essays should not be explanations of an issue; rather they should include knowledgeable arguments about an issue. DO be civil. It's appropriate to strongly criticize ideas, reasoning or positions that you disagree with. But it is not appropriate to make personal attacks. DO present the case from the top down. Begin with the premise of your opinion rather than assembling the facts and presenting an opinion at the end. DO be timely. Editorial sections prefer articles about current events rather than something that happened last year. DO be patient. We usually work at least a week in advance. DON'T submit essays that are written by organizations and then shopped around for an author or authors. That's a petition, not an essay. Keep the number of bylines to three or fewer. DON'T submit an ""open letter"" to an official or group. An op-ed is not a letter. DON'T key the essay to an invented ""public awareness"" event, such as Intellectual Property Day or Public Hospital Week. Indeed there might be something valuable and newsworthy to say about issues related to those or other areas, but the essay will be judged on its authentic news value, not on a created awareness event. DON'T demand review of editing or headlines. Most editors are willing to discuss editing changes for brevity or clarity but are seldom patient with nitpicking. Titles on articles submitted are rarely used. Headlines are written by staff copy editors who specialize in that skill. It is not unusual for headlines in print and online to be different. DON'T submit the same piece to different publications at the same time. Editors hate to see a piece in progress appear in another print or online publication.

This commitment is shared across our teams, including the video, UX design, product, development and quality assurance groups. Our workflows integrate accessibility into user testing recruitment/materials and standard design/development processes. These processes include an accessibility checklist that we created to help us comply with the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for 2.1 Level AA compliance. Please review our Accessibility Guide to ensure you have the best possible experience on our website and apps.

The government has clear answers for how trans citizens can change their gender markers on documents, at least until Donald Trump takes office and eliminates Joe Biden’s trans-friendly policies. It can be daunting and bureaucratic. Simple errors can derail you. But for the most part, citizens mail in generic forms, snap a photo, pay, and receive their documents in a few weeks. The process is straightforward and basically the same for everyone. For immigrants like you, lawyers told us what’s best depends on who you are and where you came from. To give an extreme example, the US is less likely to grant asylum to an undocumented transgender woman from Barcelona or Paris (I haven’t met either of you, but I’m sure you’re out there), as it would be to a Russian, Ugandan, or Honduran fleeing from danger in their home country. While we did our homework, and spoke to qualified lawyers, if there’s a law degree on our wall, I haven’t seen it. The best we can do is write a helpful, informed guide. For legal advice, speak to an immigration attorney. If you don’t have one, consider seeking low-cost or pro-bono immigration legal services in your area. Malou Chávez, executive director of Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, warned immigrants against trusting notarios, or people without law degrees who present themselves as experts of immigration law. Notarios exploit target vulnerable immigrant communities in times of confusion, like when the government announces changes to its process. “It could go different ways, but mostly it’s completing forms and providing advice even though the person is not an attorney,” she said. “Be cautious.” Though generally speaking, the advice for trans immigrants is the same as it is for trans citizens: Update your gender on federal documents while you can. The incoming Trump administration will likely make it harder to do so when it eliminates self-attestation, or the ability to proclaim your gender without a medical evaluation. We can’t be sure what exactly could change, but Trump has said that on day one of his presidency, the US government will adopt the position that there are only two genders, which he’s previously said are set at birth. For the time being, you don’t need a doctor’s letter to change the gender marker on all but one federal immigration document. If you’re applying for asylum, it may even help your case. If you’re undocumented and don’t have any forms to update, there’s a path forward for you too. None of this comes cheap. Updating your name and gender on USCIS documents can cost upwards of $495), and can’t be done all at once. Here’s how the US-CIS can make you US-Trans. If You’re Undocumented Find yourself a lawyer and file an asylum case, says Ava Benach, the founding partner at Benach and Collopy in Washington, DC. Her firm has handled hundreds of asylum cases for trans people. A trans identity makes for a strong claim because, despite the constant legislative attacks of the past four years, the United States remains one of the safest countries for trans people in the world. A trans Central American walking from Guatemala or El Salvador is not passing through many places they’d be free from a well-founded fear of persecution. “If you’re a trans person who’s come into the country in the last year, get yourself to a lawyer and consider applying for asylum,” Benach says. “But if you have been here longer than a year [and missed the deadline to file form I-589], there are commonly accepted exceptions to that rule.” Those exceptions include a person not identifying as trans until they’d lived in the states, starting hormone replacement therapy, updating identity documents, or an HIV diagnosis, which is statistically more common in the trans community and grounds for persecution on its own. Immigration attorneys say it’s common for immigrants from countries hostile to LGBTQ people not to explore their identity until they’ve been here for some time—either because it wasn’t safe or because in their culture, queer identity was flattened into a broader category of “something someone should never be.” Sometimes it’s masculine lesbians and feminine men figuring out their true gender identity, other times transgender men and women realize non-binary better describes them. These things take time and experience to discover, which doesn’t change the reality that deportation after transition could be dangerous—making a strong case for asylum. Trans people ineligible for asylum could instead qualify for withholding of removal, an alternate, less stable pathway of protection which allows someone to stay in the US indefinitely on a work permit. While withholding blocks the government from deporting a person to their home country, the US still has the ability to send them to another country that would take them, Benach says. Kelsey Shamrell-Harrington, managing attorney at LGBTQ immigrant legal services organization Entre Hermanos, says there’s growing consciousness among immigration judges that gender identity is fluid, especially for those escaping bigotry. It can depend on where the court is located, but “you’d be surprised,” she said. Her clients often ask if a judge will discriminate against them if they change their name or gender during asylum proceedings. “The US government is not authorized to discriminate against somebody because they’re trans,” Shamrell-Harrington says. “Being a transgender person generally means you’ll be more vulnerable for future violence. For that reason, I try to discourage people from letting the fear of what government officials think prevent them from living their truth, especially when their truth can be ultimately so protective for them.” Under current USCIS policy, LGBT are members of a protected group whose persecution makes them eligible for asylum. The Biden’s administration has already severely restricted asylum eligibility. A process made more difficult by Democrats will be made even worse by Trump. Project 2025, which we should consider a policy model until proven otherwise, calls for “asylum reform,” to eliminate expedited pathways, raise the standard for credible fear of persecution, and eliminate the “vague and overbroad” protections for social groups. But Trump won’t have ultimate power. He can initiate mass deportation without congressional approval, but making the changes suggested by Project 2025 would require action in the House and Senate. Not that that’s out of the question. Come Inauguration Day, conservatives will control all three branches of government. And like last time, Trump is likely to pack the courts with federally appointed judges sympathetic to Making the Bench Great Again. Fortunately, any changes will face lawsuits (and the last Trump administration lost lawsuits all the time). Remember Plants vs. Zombies? The next four years are going to be like that, but with lawyers throttling unjust law and policy. All the same, this oncoming shift is one of the compelling reasons undocumented trans people should consider filing for asylum today. Even if government workers want to accept these claims, they’ll have their marching orders from Trump. The biggest risks for any undocumented immigrant are detainment and deportation, but Benach says the danger is acute for trans immigrants, particularly undocumented trans women, who have suffered in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers. Anything that initiates a criminal process, from arrest to conviction, can draw ICE to an undocumented immigrant, and a significant number of trans people rely on sex work to pay the bills. The National Transgender Discrimination survey found 13% trans people have done sex work. The majority are trans women, who report discrimination keeping them out of other jobs. The risk of arrest could grow as more states consider criminalizing trans people from using single-gender facilities like bathrooms. Still, being trans in and of itself is not grounds for deportation and Trump is not prioritizing their removal. “If there’s going to be raids, it’s going to be at meat processing plants and construction sites. It’s going to be in buildings full of undocumented people,” Benach said. “If you don’t get arrested, chances are you’re not likely to become a target.” If You Are Documented In March 2023, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) updated its policy manual to accept self-identified gender markers for people requesting immigration benefits, and that gender marker does not need to match supporting documents. (At present, and likely for the foreseeable future, USCIS will only offer binary gender markers). USCIS provides instructions for correcting Arrival-departure records, employment authorization documents, permanent resident cards, and various travel documents. Applicants do not need to supply proof of their gender, with the exception of those replacing their naturalization certificate. If you have an employment authorization form or Green Card, you should also update your gender marker with the Social Security Administration. It’s free. Naturalized citizens should also update their US passports. Attorneys said they could think of very few instances where updating any of these documents could put someone in harm’s way—mostly having to do with how soon after a person submitted their forms after an arrest or conviction when they’d be better off laying low than catching the attention of the immigration authorities. If you’re seeking asylum and authorized to work, updating your documents could even help build a persuasive argument if it’s consistent with your case and your story. In many instances, it’s totally neutral. Even though the USCIS handles all these forms, changing each one comes with a slightly different process and price. The agency doesn’t change them all at once, lawyers said. Immigrants do not need to change all these forms–in fact, mismatched markers between USCIS documents are okay. In some cases, immigrants may not want to change them, either. For instance, most people aren’t presenting their arrival-departure records on a daily basis and travel documents are sometimes one-off. For some, it may be safest to avoid changing these: Border guards are not primarily known for friendliness and understanding, and if the gender marker on the passport from your home country does not match the gender marker on your USCIS-issued travel documentation, you could run into trouble when leaving or re-entering the country. Lawyers say to prioritize the documents you share with your employer and the authorities: Employment Authorization and Green Cards. Although you probably don’t keep a Naturalization Certificate rolled up in your pocket for daily use, you can change it. Immigration law is hard to DIY. Some immigration attorneys say you should consult your immigration attorney before you file any documents, while others say you can probably manage these steps on your own. If in doubt, send an email. Your immigration attorney probably has an opinion, too. Looping in an attorney won’t slow or accelerate the process. Everyone is subject to the same processing times. Fees vary from document to document. Here’s the department’s latest fee schedule, which is subject to change. Changing the Name or Gender Marker on your Employment Authorization Document For those who don’t know the ins-and-outs of this process, an employment authorization document (EAD) is what it sounds like: A document that allows foreign nationals to work in the US. But these physical cards serve the same important purpose as any photo ID. They’re typically valid for one year, and can be renewed at the halfway mark, six months before they expire. That’s as good a time as any to update the gender on this document. To update your gender marker on an employment authorization document, submit form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. If you’re renewing your EAF, try to submit this document at least 180 days before your current card expires (if you apply early, USCIS automatically extends authorization for 540 days). Check the box that suits you. At $495, this necessary annual expense is not cheap. When filling out the form, check filing category 1.b. Replacement of a lost, stolen or damaged EAD not due to USCIS error. With your form and filing fee, submit supporting documentation including: Depending on where you’re from—or if you’re a refugee, or asylee, a student, etc.—the USCIS might want something more from you. Check the special requirements here. If you’re eligible, you can file online here. If you can’t wait because you’re worried about Trump changing USCIS policy before it makes sense to renew your EAD, you can request a replacement from USCIS with the same form. If you don’t have an online account, you can also contact updategenderinfo@uscis.dhs.gov to request a correction to your name or gender marker. USCIS will ask you for the card with your old gender marker. Wait times for a new document may vary. Attorneys gave us different answers ranging from a minimum of three weeks to 11 months, depending on why you qualify for a work permit. Typically, they say the process is l shortest for asylum seekers and longest for parolees. To update your name on an employment authorization form, you will submit all the same documentation as you would for a gender marker change—plus a court order after you legally change your name in a District or Superior Court. (In Washington, name changes are automatically sealed in Superior Court). You don’t need to be a citizen to change your name in the US. Once you have a court order, provide it to USCIS with your application to renew. USCIS may ask you for a letter explaining why you’re changing biographic information. You shouldn’t expect to be asked for “proof” like a doctor’s letter, but it does happen. “Not to call anyone out, but I’ve seen it more from Texas,” says Kelsey Shamrell-Harrington, managing attorney at LGBTQ immigrant legal services organization Entre Hermanos. Seven out of ten times, her trans clients can update their gender no problem. It’s those three other times the department asks for documentation. USCIS will accept basically any letter from a medical professional confirming you are who you say you are. If an LGBTQ health clinic or LGBT-aware general practitioner is prescribing you hormones, they likely deal with this for insurance all the time, and would be able to quickly email one to you. Advocates for Trans Equality has this sample letter as well. Additionally, if you are scheduled for an interview with USCIS based on a pending application, you can also update your gender marker in person. That includes removal proceedings. Malou Chávez, executive director of Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, says asylum seekers should know their employment authorization and case are linked. If you update your gender or name on your card, make sure to update the court’s records as well. “That’s just different things attorneys and advocates know,” she says. “The process is so complex. While one person may not necessarily need an attorney to replace documents, it’s always advised. Presumably the attorney knows to think about all the different questions and possibilities.” An asylee can inform USCIS of a change to name or gender during one of those meetings. But if it’s far enough out, your attorney could also file a motion to amend your name and/or gender in the court’s records. “They’ve been very receptive to that,” Shamrell-Harrington says. “I’ve mostly practiced in the Seattle office. So if you’re practicing in Georgia, your experience may be different.” Changing the Name or Gender Marker on your Green Card. File form I-90 and pay the $495 fee to replace it. Under Part 2 of form I-90, or “Application Type,” check box 2.e., “My name or other biographic information has legally changed since the issuance of my existing card.” Look under “Specific Instructions” on page three of this form to determine what supporting documents USCIS requires from you. It depends on who you are and how you got here. For example, marriage-based Green Cards require marriage certificates, and employment-based Green Cards require a job offer. Generally though, prepare scanned photocopies of your current Green Card (front and back), valid passport (opened to the page with your photo and personal information), Social Security Card, and birth certificate. If USCIS requests an original copy of a document, the department will send it back to you. You’ll also submit the Green Card with your incorrect information. You can file online here. If you’re just changing your gender marker, check male or female. If you’re changing your name, see Item 4. Check yes and proceed to items 5.a. to 5.c. On the form, provide your name exactly as it is on your current Green Card. Along with your supporting documents, provide the court order from your legal name change in District or Superior Court. (Like all government forms, you can’t change your name on a permanent resident card until you’ve obtained a court ordered name change). Changing the Name or Gender on Your Naturalization Certificate File form N-565, along with the $555 filing fee and the supporting evidence outlined in this document. As of April, the government allows people to change their gender marker to X. To change your name, you’ll also need to provide a court ordered name change. To change both your name and gender, USCIS requires: If you’re applying from overseas and provide a foreign address, the department will send your new naturalization certificate to the nearest consulate, embassy, or USCIS field office to your address. You’ll get a letter telling you where to pick it up. Is This Going to Put Me at Risk? This is by far the most common question we’ve received. Many trans US citizens and immigrants alike are concerned changing their name and documents will put them on a government list, but according to every single expert and trans advocate that we’ve spoken to about this for months, in this rare instance, not fitting into the system benefits trans people. Changing your name or gender-marker on government documents will create a record of some kind. Federal agencies don’t process gender-marker changes with special gender-marker change forms. They’re the same generic forms everyone uses for applying and renewing. The federal government likely won’t be able to search for those specific records without an expensive overhaul to their databases. Why spend the money when surveilling social media is a easier and faster way to find trans people? That’s not to say delete your social media, but it's helpful to stack concrete vulnerabilities against the government actions of our nightmares. Plus, as advocates pointed out, statistics show trans people who carry documentation that doesn’t match their appearance are at risk of violence already. “Somebody needs to balance their own immediate day to day safety against the hypothetical risks,” said Olivia Hunt, policy director at the National Center for Trans Equality. According to the 2015 US Trans Survey, the largest dataset on trans people in the US currently available, nearly one-third (32%) of trans people who presented an identity document that did not match their presentation experienced discrimination, denial of service, and violence. But risk is a personal assessment. If you’re anxious, consider pushing through the feeling and ask what you’d do if you weren’t afraid. Ultimately, only you know the right answer.

IN SUCH STATES, OUR LIABILITY AND THE LIABILITY OF OUR AFFILIATES, AGENTS AND LICENSORS IS LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY SUCH STATE LAW.)

LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES WILL BE LIMITED AND EXCLUDED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PRECEDING SENTENCE EVEN IF ANY REMEDY PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. DISPUTE RESOLUTION Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and the CMG Affiliate (including any parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, officers, directors, employees, or agents of ours) agree that any dispute, claim, disagreements arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, or the Agreement and prior versions of the Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of this Agreement (each, a “Dispute”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that: (1) you and the CMG Affiliate may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (2) you and the CMG Affiliate may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). For purposes of this Arbitration Agreement, “Dispute” will also include disputes that arose or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of the Agreement as well as claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement. This Arbitration Agreement does not prevent you from filing or joining a complaint with any federal, state or local government agency that is authorized by law to seek relief against us on your behalf. Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND THE CMG AFFILIATE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and the CMG Affiliate are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the paragraph entitled “Applicability of Arbitration Agreement” above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. Discovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in court. Class Action Waiver. YOU AND THE CMG AFFILIATE AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN THE PARAGRAPH ENTITLED “BATCH ARBITRATION” BELOW, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party's individual claim. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this subsection, “Class Action Waiver” are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and the CMG Affiliate agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and shall be pursued in the state or federal courts located in Fulton County, Georgia. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This subsection does not prevent you or the CMG Affiliate from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims. Informal Dispute Resolution. You and the CMG Affiliate that operates the Service agree to try to resolve any Dispute informally before resorting to arbitration. You and the CMG Affiliate therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement (“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference. The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference (“Notice”), which shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to the CMG Affiliate that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to notice@cmg.com or regular mail to our offices located at 1601 W. Peachtree St. NE, Atlanta, GA 30309, Attention: Legal Department. Notice to you will be sent to the email address associated with your account or to your publicly available address or email address if you do not have an account with us. The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute./ The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section. Arbitration Procedures. You and the CMG Affiliate that operates the Service agree that this Arbitration Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., applies. If the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within 60 days after receipt of your Notice, you and the CMG Affiliate agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. All arbitrations shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""). The AAA's rules are available on its website at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If the claim asserted in arbitration is for less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes then in effect will apply. If the claim asserted is for $75,000 or more, the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect will apply. If there is a conflict between the AAA's rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control. A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”). The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration. To initiate arbitration, you must send the Request to Legal Department, 1601 W. Peachtree Street, NE, Atlanta, GA 30309. If we initiate arbitration, we will send the Request to the email address associated with your account or to your publicly available address or email address if you do not have an account with us. Both parties must comply with the AAA's rules regarding initiation of arbitration. Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable AAA rules. The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). Unless you and the CMG Affiliate otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed below is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Arbitrator. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within 35 days of delivery of the Request, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA rules, provided that if the Batch Arbitration process described below is triggered, the AAA will appoint the arbitrator for each batch. Authority of Arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to the paragraph entitled “Class Action Waiver,” including any claim that that same paragraph is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that it has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in the paragraph entitled “Batch Arbitration,” all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. Batch Arbitration. To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and the CMG Affiliate agree that in the event that there are 100 or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against the CMG Affiliate by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a 30 day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), the AAA shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award (“Batch Arbitration”). All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by the CMG Affiliate. You and the CMG Affiliate agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. 30-Day Right to Opt Out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Legal Department, 1601 W. Peachtree Street, NE, Atlanta, GA 30309, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us. If the Dispute is not covered by any arbitration agreement between you and us, it shall proceed before the state or federal courts located in Fulton County, Georgia. Invalidity, Expiration. Except as provided in the subsection entitled “Class Action Waiver” above, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if the CMG Affiliate makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will notify you. Unless you reject the change within 30 days of such change become effective by writing to the CMG Affiliate at Legal Department, 1601 W. Peachtree Street, NE, Atlanta, GA 30309, your continued use of the Service constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of this Agreement and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Service, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the Agreement (or accepted any subsequent changes to this Agreement) remain in full force and effect. The CMG Affiliate will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of this Agreement.

To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise the AAA, and the AAA shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process (“Administrative Arbitrator”). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by the CMG Affiliate. You and the CMG Affiliate agree to cooperate in good faith with the AAA to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings. 30-Day Right to Opt Out.

If the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within 60 days after receipt of your Notice, you and the CMG Affiliate agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. All arbitrations shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (""AAA""). The AAA's rules are available on its website at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. If the claim asserted in arbitration is for less than $75,000, the AAA's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes then in effect will apply. If the claim asserted is for $75,000 or more, the Commercial Arbitration Rules then in effect will apply. If there is a conflict between the AAA's rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control. A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the “Request”). The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration.

Both parties must comply with the AAA's rules regarding initiation of arbitration. Your responsibility to pay any AAA fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable AAA rules. The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). Unless you and the CMG Affiliate otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed below is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Arbitrator.

And I, like you, and your cat, hate the Blue Angels, hate the sky-ripping rocket-racket. But we are in a military empire. To pretend otherwise, I still believe, is to prefer the illusion to the reality. I have said this before (two years ago to be exact), and it deserves repeating because, despite all that’s going on with Trump, nothing about the US has fundamentally changed. And I say this as a person who voted for Kamala Harris, and would vote for her again and again. Getting rid of the Blue Angels will only hide the fact that our society is a military empire. There is a good reason why the US's defense spending is still, by far, the largest in the world. This is not simply a waste of money (though that reading, which has its intellectual birth in The Grundrisse and is developed by Rosa Luxemburg. has economic value and cannot be easily dismissed). But it's the raw power to hurt and kill that makes the excessive (even obscene) consumption Americans enjoy possible: cheap goods at Walmart and Amazon, access to the resources needed to lock consumers into automobile debt, and way too low prices at the pump (even in Washington State). In the same way we should not sweep the homeless from the streets (putting aside the humanitarian argument for it, of course), we should not scrub the Blue Angels from our skies. The suffering our rich society deliberately throws onto its streets does not go away when it's swept out of sight. And yet, this is what many left-leaning voters want: the consequences of the unreal inflation of housing prices, the absence of anything close to meaningful social housing, and the rejection of rent controls made invisible. The removal of the Blue Angels will only increase the size of Seattle's famous liberal bubble. But it will not in any way impact American militarism. We will have peaceful skies in early August while we are still in the heart of the empire, still supporting the armed forces in Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey, Egypt, El Salvador, and elsewhere. Submarines with nuclear weapons will still be a ferry ride away from downtown. The last thing we should have is a mind whose sky is eternally clear of the Blue Angels and the Navy that supports this spectacle. When you are putting gas into your car and the sudden roar of the jets shatters your nerves, do not separate what you are doing from what just flew over you. The latter makes the former possible. The sequence is ideology in a state of perfection, which means: It's actually telling the truth. This is how the system functions. This is the empire as it is: the baseball park in Seattle, the army base in Tacoma; the cruise ships on the Sound, the nuclear submarines beneath the Sound; homes on San Juan Islands, the battleships serviced in Everett. A weaker ideology (and there is no such thing as no ideology) results from a sky without the Blue Angels. We may or may not like the truth of their noise and the empire they represent and impose, but this is where you live, this is how you eat, and this is the traffic jam you often find yourself in. And hating Trump, as most in Seattle do, doesn't change this fact. In the way change is not likely if we do not see the homeless, change is not likely if we do not see that our form of consumption is not outside but very much inside of the empire.",,"['housing', 'homeless']",4.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.309167,3446

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/06/14/80100983/everything-you-want-to-know-about-protesting-in-seattle,The Stranger (Web),Everything You Want to Know About Protesting in Seattle Just Can't Get Enough?,"There are two major protests planned in Seattle this weekend: one that starts in Cal Anderson Park and plans to march to Seattle Center, and another at the University of Washington's Red Square. Meanwhile, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has said that it's preparing to deploy its Special Response Teams to five cities run by Democratic leaders, including Seattle. This is a lot! So we talked to local attorneys and advocates to help protesters figure out how to show up, mitigate their risk of arrest, and stay safe. How can protesters choose to mitigate their risk of arrest? The highest risk of arrest comes when police issue dispersal orders—which typically happens if they believe there’s a risk of riot, disruption, or a threat to public safety (which leaves a lot of room for police discretion). “In Seattle, police officers are obligated to announce their instruction to protesters to disperse,” one local attorney told The Stranger. “If you hear them do that, you should disperse if you want to avoid being arrested. But, officers don't always make that announcement audibly (or at all), and sometimes don't allow crowds time and room to disperse. In that event, you should maintain self-awareness for your personal safety and comfort level. If you feel the tension around you start to rise, or you see officers begin to change their body language toward interacting with the crowd, you may want to find an exit route quickly.” If you’re at a protest, there’s a good chance that you’ll interact with police at some point. “Plan ahead,” says Katie Walker, the communications director from CAIR-WA. “Police interaction is stressful and all planning helps keep all participants safe. Use de-escalation techniques. Identify group liaisons for law enforcement and make sure all group members know who is chosen. Identify and support group individuals who may have specific exposure concerns.” “When interacting with law enforcement: Stay calm,” Walker says. “Make sure to keep your hands visible. Don’t argue, resist, or obstruct the police, even if you believe they are violating your rights. If you can safely do so, point out that you are not disrupting anyone else’s activity and that the First Amendment protects your actions.” If arrested or detained, when should a protester speak to law enforcement? Attorneys and advocates gave us a very short list of words she suggests people say to law enforcement: ""Am I free to go?"" If the answer is “yes,” go. If it’s “no,” tell them, ""I would like a lawyer."" Then say nothing. “If you start talking to the cops, even chit chat, you are potentially waiving your right to remain silent,” Danni Askini from Gender Justice League (GJL) says. “Unless your life is in imminent danger and they are in a position to save your life, remain silent at all times.” “There's no reason to speak to law enforcement at a protest, and it's absolutely okay not to,” the local attorney told The Stranger. “There is nothing you can say to a law enforcement officer that will improve your situation or the situation of anyone around you.” Can law enforcement require you to share identifying information? “If you are just at a protest, under Article 1 Section 7 of our state constitution—no, police cannot demand to see identity information or demand your name,” says Askini from GJL. However, you must identify yourself “if you are under arrest and an officer can articulate probable cause that you have committed a crime,” Askini says. Then “you are required by law to give your legal name or you can be charged with obstruction of justice.” What can a protester do to protect their privacy, especially in regards to technology? “Be as analog as possible,” the local attorney told us. “If you can make a plan with your people to meet up at a certain location if you get separated instead of relying on texts, do that. Make an arrangement with someone at home that if you're not home by a certain time, they should check the King County Inmate Lookup to see if you've been arrested. If you need your phone, make sure it's locked with a passcode, not facial recognition or a fingerprint, and keep it on airplane mode as much as possible.” Walker from CAIR-WA recommends that if you keep your phone, turn off all location services, don’t use digital payments like Apple Pay or credit cards, cover cameras when you’re not using them, disable Bluetooth, and don’t scan QR codes or connect to public wifi. “Cell phones are spies in your pocket,” says Askini from GJL. “They place you at the scene of a potential crime, can be collected and shared with federal officials who may later decide to prosecute people in the vicinity.” As we head into a summer that could be full of protest action, Askini suggests that people “consider purchasing a MeshTastic device, setting it up with friends, and creating a mesh network to communicate with each other. We are moving into a totalitarian era, we should all be more mindful” Facial recognition is a thing. How can protesters protect against that? Are protest mask bans enforceable? “People have a right to cover their faces in Washington State and there are no specific laws prohibiting masks in public,” Askini says. “There are no state laws that explicitly ban face coverings at protests. However, if you engage in vandalism/assault and are caught, concealing your identity could be argued by prosecutors to be an aggravating factor.” Who should a protester call if they are arrested or detained? Most people we spoke to recommended the National Lawyers Guild at 206-OK-TRY-ME (check their instagram for hotline hours before you go). “They should also have a very trusted friend, family member, or ally who is prepared to take action if they are arrested,” says Askini from GJL. “Since you may only get one call, you should prepare the person on the outside to make several calls on your behalf.” What steps should a protester take if they feel their rights have been violated? “Start documenting as soon as you can,” the local attorney told us. “Write down what happened step by step. Remember the 5 Ws [who, what, where, when, why], but also record details, like which side of the street you were on, what time it was, what you remember about the appearance or statements of the officers, etc. Your thoughts will be jumbled, but that's okay. Ask a friend to take notes and help you get organized so you can just flow.” In terms of other documentation, they say, “take photos of any injuries you have and write down how you feel over a few days. Often injuries don't appear immediately. Get a medical exam as soon as possible so that you have a medical record of your injuries as well. Don't worry so much about whether the law was broken or not—just record all the information about your experience as soon as you can, and worry about the legal part after a few days.” “Make sure to put this in an envelope and mail it to yourself or have it printed and notorized - Having a time stamped ""contemporary account"" of your experience can be helpful in the future. This is also important for any time you may be interviewed, appear in court, or be put before a deposition,” says Askini from GJL. “I'm not going to lie, getting justice after a mass arrest can be demoralizing, frustrating, and slow,” says Askini. “After a protest at the 2004 Republican convention in NYC, I was arrested, put against a wall in an alley, and repeatedly peppersprayed while being handcuffed. It was 10 years before the City of New York settled the lawsuit related to the mistreatment of arrestees. What it took was patience, persistence, and an unwavering commitment to secure justice.” Should protesters avoid posting to social media? “Reasonable minds can differ on this,” the local attorney says. “I tend to think protest social media is best left to the many journalists and livestreamers who are set up to document protests. But, if you do want to document your view of the protest, for example, if you want to livestream or document police violence happening in front of you, I recommend turning off location data and blurring the faces of any other protesters you capture if you can. We know for sure that law enforcement uses social media to locate people they want to target, sometimes days or weeks after the event. With all kinds of image searching software available and frequent cooperation between social media companies and law enforcement, your private profile may not actually be very private, and you don't have control over how your social media post might be used once it's up.” Is it safe for immigrants to protest in Seattle this weekend? “All non-citizens can be negatively impacted by interactions with law enforcement,” says Walker from CAIR-WA. She suggests carrying identity documents on your person, and for temporary visa holders, review the restrictions on your visa. “Safety is relative. Immigrants are only as safe as law enforcement and ICE will allow them to be,” says the local attorney. “Washington's Keep Washington Working Act prohibits local and state law enforcement from cooperating with ICE, but that doesn't mean it's not happening, unfortunately. And, we can expect ICE to be in the streets as well as local law enforcement. Undocumented immigrants are at the most risk if they are arrested, but anyone who is documented but on a conditional status like waiting for a citizenship interview or an asylum hearing may also be at risk of an arrest damaging their application. We know the Trump administration has cancelled the visas of protesters as well. It's a very personal decision, but I think anyone without citizenship should think through their decision really carefully.” How can other protesters support immigrant protesters? “I think people can start by considering how their actions may or may not put other protesters at risk of arrest,” says Askini. “I've been to probably more than 100 protests since 1998. I've seen a lot. When white protesters escalate violence with police in the presence of non-violent protesters who are immigrants, BIPOC, or trans, they are assuming that other people will have the same experience in the criminal legal system as they will if there are mass arrests, and they won't.” “Before you go, look up strategies for de-arresting people, and practice with your protest group,” says the local attorney. “If you're white and a citizen, put yourself between law enforcement and BIPOC folks as much as possible (if an arrest is in process, be careful to either not interfere or prepare to also be arrested). Even if you're just marching or rallying and the police are just standing around monitoring, put yourself on the outer edge. If you do see someone being arrested by ICE, ask them their name before the officers take them, try to get the badge name or number of the arresting officers, then contact WAISN or NWIRP with as much information as possible about where the arrest took place and the name of the person so they can provide support.” What steps have you personally taken to protect yourself and others when attending protests? “I believe in having a designated police negotiator, a clear press spokesperson, and a clear message!” says Askini. “The worst case scenario is when mass arrests begin and people who are not intending to get arrested for an action get swept up in mass arrests. While people can see negotiating with the cops as somehow ‘collaborating,’ I see it as a diplomatic endeavor that can stall arrests, extend the protest, ensure solidarity and allow people to make decisions for themselves about if they want to be arrested or not. I believe in doing our best to be strategic in our approach—while the crowd can react, situations can escalate, having a plan with things like legal observers, medics that are clearly mapped, press that are nearby to document and report, and clarity about who is in command of the protest is vital.” “When I go, I make sure to mask, and I wear comfortable shoes and I usually have my bike helmet with me (I like riding there so I can exit quickly if I need to), some gloves, and a couple of bottles of water and snacks,” says the local attorney. “But the biggest thing I bring is my mindset. I think the most damaging thing I can bring to a protest is the idea that a protest has to be ‘peaceful.’ Protests are, by definition, disruptive. When protesters start policing each other and coming in with a mindset that a protest has to be ‘peaceful, it shifts the accountability for police violence away from police and toward other protesters. We don't have to all want to use the same tactics in order to be in solidarity with each other.” If you are an organizer, what protest tactics do you hope to see this weekend? What do you hope people will avoid? “I understand the desire of protesters to fuck shit up, but I truly hope to see less escalatory ‘taking the bait’ this weekend,” says Askini. “The Trump Administration wants an escalation so that they can pull a Reichstag Fire and call in the national guard and military. Why take the bait Seattle? We are smarter than that shit. Out smart the police and feds. Lots of smaller protests all over the city grinding things to a halt is WAY more disruptive, smart, and difficult to manage. Avoid direct confrontations. Keep it bussin! Stay on the move and don't get bogged down in one location. The most annoying protests are ones the police and authorities can't predict.”",,"['public safety', 'police']",4.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.311168,13433

Real Change has not publicly released the names or any information about the vendors, but says both were “dedicated.” Real Change shared the vendors’ names and registration numbers with The Stranger. We used ICE’s Online Detainee Locator System to verify their detention at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma. Most of Real Change’s self-employed vendors, who buy the paper for $0.60 and make a $1.40 profit from each $2 sale, are homeless or formerly homeless. Selling the paper on the street is a way for vendors, who often struggle to break into the wider job market, to make money. In its press release, Real Change said many of the city’s most vulnerable people are undocumented immigrants who are working to survive “and lift themselves up out of poverty” through programs like theirs. It has asked the public to donate to its legal defense fund. “This is not merely an unfortunate incident; it is a calculated act of cruelty and intimidation that goes against the very fabric of our mission and our city's values,” said Krystal Marx, Executive Director of Real Change, in a press release. “Our vendors are not ‘others’—they are our neighbors, our colleagues, and the heart of this organization. To see them targeted and detained by a federal agency is an outrage that we will not stand for.” In May, Donald Trump’s administration tripled ICE’s arrest quota and the agency started arresting more immigrants with no criminal history or criminal charges against them. In June, they accounted for more than half (53 percent) of the people ICE arrested in Washington, Oregon and Alaska, according to data from UC Berkeley School of Law’s Deportation Data Project. It’s still unclear exactly why, when, and where ICE detained the Real Change vendors. The nonprofit said it is still trying to reach them and will release additional information about them under the “Advocacy” tab on its website.",,"['homeless', 'chan (title)']",3.5,2025-08-05T19:10:44.336136,2043

https://www.thestranger.com/queer/2025/02/04/79905654/fucking-political,The Stranger (Web),Fucking Political Just Can't Get Enough?,"On July 3, 1981, the New York Times announced the coming plague with a short news item tucked into Section A, Page 20: “Rare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals.” Nobody knew the purple Kaposi’s Sarcoma lesions the article described were the mark of a virus that eviscerated the immune system and left the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections. A quote from the dermatologist Dr. Alvin E. Friedman-Kien described the outbreak as “quite devastating.” Millions would die from what doctors first called GRID, or Gay-Related Immune Deficiency, a name that linked gayness with death. But when it became clear the mysterious illness affected people other than gay men, it was renamed AIDS, or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. A French virologist discovered HIV in 1983, but the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention wouldn’t list it as the sole AIDS-causing agent for another two years. Ten more years passed before researchers announced a breakthrough: protease inhibitors, the first truly effective HIV medication. Patients who could tolerate the drugs astounded their doctors. Some were pulled from the brink of death. They called it the “Lazarus effect.” AIDS arrived just 12 years after the Stonewall Uprising. Anonymity gave way to a radical vision of public parades and sexual freedom. Many felt fucking in bathhouses, bookstores, public parks, and clubs were not just revolutionary acts, but part of a revolutionary responsibility. This sentiment collided catastrophically with HIV. The virus first consumed gay men in sexually liberated New York and San Francisco. Cases climbed exponentially in 1981, and the epidemic soon exploded. Men who seemed healthy on a Wednesday could be dead by Sunday. Nurses and doctors were disgusted and afraid of the illness and the people who had it. They allowed patients to languish in soiled bed sheets and die alone, while bigoted visitation policies separated them from friends and lovers. In the first story about AIDS to air on a major television network, 27-year-old Ken Ramsauer told Geraldo Rivera that he heard nurses’ aides outside his hospital room speculating “how long the faggot in 208 is going to last.” Ramsauer died four days later. The explanation for why young, healthy gay men were dying was years away. With little outside help, the community devised its own solutions, including a brand new idea called safe sex. Dr. Joseph Sonnabend recommended a biopsy the day he discovered swollen glands all over Richard Berkowitz’s body. Berkowitz, who’d left grad school for a more lucrative gig as a sadomasochistic master to suburban men, didn’t take his doctor’s advice until learning another hustler had died. Berkowitz soon yanked his ads from the Advocate, a national gay magazine, and cut his business line. When Dr. Sonnabend, who had already suspected the coming epidemic, fingered similarly hard lymph nodes on Michael Callen’s neck, he weighed his favorite patient’s promiscuity against his likelihood of musical success, and told him to leave New York, prompting an angry reaction. Callen, after a phone call from an apologetic Sonnabend, agreed to donate a small blood sample for Sonnabend’s study of gay men of a similar profile: swollen glands, a history of STIs, and no lesions. Tests revealed a compromised immune system. Callen called home and told his parents he’d be dead of cancer in six months. Dr. Sonnabend eventually connected his two patients, who shared a desire to spread the word and a belief in their doctor’s “multifactorial” theory of AIDS. Sonnabend theorized repeated exposure to STIs and human cytomegaloviruses, which cause chickenpox, herpes, and mono, better explained the total immune collapse than the emergence of a new virus (the then-unknown HIV). He saw sexual liberation as enabling this death by one thousand cuts. Callen and Berkowitz concluded gay men did not know the possible danger of sex. Feeling a responsibility to sound the alarm, they published “We Know Who We Are” in the New York Native, a gay newspaper in Greenwich Village. Warning readers against sex in bathhouses, they wrote, “What ten years ago was viewed as a healthy reaction to a sex-negative culture now threatens to destroy the very fabric of urban gay male life … the obvious and immediate solution to the present crisis is the end of urban gay male promiscuity as we know it today.” The backlash was instant and scathing. As author and former Native staff writer David France wrote in his 2016 book How to Survive a Plague, the men were called “sex-negative hysterics” and “self-flagellators” in the paper’s subsequent editions. Articles in the Village Voice denounced them. An editorial printed in a Toronto gay paper accused them of spinning 200 diagnoses of “GRID” into a crisis, pointing out that twice as many gay men had died in traffic accidents in the same time period. Callen and Berkowitz were, of course, right—AIDS was sexually transmitted and gravely serious—but sometimes it’s not what you say, but how you say it. The inspiration for one of the earliest safe sex guides for gay men came with a bang at Berkowitz’s door. A former client had driven from Connecticut in a frenzy to ask if Berkowitz was okay. Berkowitz, who explained what AIDS was, expected the man to freak out. Instead, he asked if Berkowitz would put on his leather and boots while he jerked off. “I was in shock!” Berkowitz told The Stranger in a phone call last month. As a sex worker, Berkowitz could imagine a more expansive sexual world, where sex could take many forms. His client reminded Berkowitz safety and enjoyment were not mutually exclusive concepts: “It was an education to me to see how many different ways there were for men to get sexual pleasure that had been haunting them, that they were craving for, where they can access it and pay for it and not be ashamed of it.” With help from Dr. Sonnabend, Berkowitz and Callen started work on a booklet they called How to Have Sex in an Epidemic: One Approach, published in 1983. Dr. Sonnabend insisted the booklet begin with a scientific rationale for gay men to alter their sexual behavior. Callen and Berkowitz followed that explanation with practical advice. While the science is dated, the nonjudgmental, sex-positive tone is contemporary. People would continue having sex regardless, so they encouraged readers to treat their partners with love (even for a night) and their own health as precious. The guidance met people where they were at. For instance, Sonnabend noticed his patients who were bottoms who liked being fucked were more likely to get sick. The authors advised readers on the risks of receptive anal sex. They acknowledged that some gay men were defensive about these warnings because of homophobic stereotypes. (“Remember that the issue is disease—not sex,” they wrote.) They explained that sperm could carry a virus and infectious agents can easily penetrate the rectal lining. Providing a condom to your partner was the best way to stay safe, they advised. For tops who couldn’t adjust, they suggested another compromise: “Let your partner fuck you without a rubber and make sure that he either pulls out or puts a rubber on before he cums.” How to Have Sex in an Epidemic provided similarly frank guidance on ethics and responsibility, selecting partners, washing up before sex, buying and selling sex, blowjobs, fist fucking, no-risk methods like mutual masturbation and fingering, dildos, and S&M. They addressed the reality that men with AIDS were having sex: “AIDS patients are human beings and need affection and human contact. AIDS patients object to being treated like lepers and some end up taking this anger and frustration out to the baths and backrooms. The issue of AIDS patients having sex must be viewed from two perspectives: the risk to the patient and the potential risk to the partner.” France, author of How to Survive a Plague, remembers the booklet changing the culture in New York City nearly overnight. “It was night and day,” he said. “It didn’t just give you the rules of things to not do, but it said, ‘This is how we can build a life’ in this incredibly dark time.” Unbeknownst to Callen and Berkowitz, a protesting band of nun habit wearing drag queens in San Francisco called the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence came to the same conclusions about safe sex and condom use the year before. The Sisters’ 1982 zine “Play Fair!”—black, white, and pink and illustrated with comic nuns—introduced readers to STIs like syphilis, herpes, hepatitis, and intestinal parasites, as well as Kaposi’s Sarcoma and pneumocystis pneumonia, two symptoms of the “severe problems with immune systems” arising for gay men in large American cities. (The Sisters also added “guilt” to this list, “SYMPTOMS APPEAR: 2 to 3 years of age and persist in many cases throughout one’s life.) It’s possible that one booklet written by two AIDS patients and their doctor, and another written by drag queens, saved thousands of lives, and that their influence is still felt in every bowl of condoms in a gay bar or health clinic in America. (Moreover, we have a guy from Connecticut with a leather kink to thank). The concept of sexual harm reduction influenced mainstream medicine. While scientists cracked the biomedical puzzle of HIV, AIDS still kills. Even as researchers develop evermore effective HIV treatments, including injections that can replace months of daily pills, advancements are meaningless without access. Basic human problems of poverty, homelessness, and convoluted healthcare systems have stymied efforts to end the pandemic. (Such a thing is possible. In 1980, the World Health Organization eradicated smallpox, one of the most deadly illnesses in human history, through vaccination). Donald Trump’s administration is radically hostile to public health and bodily autonomy. Just weeks into his term, he’s already threatening HIV medications for people outside the US. Trump through PEPFAR, which supplies HIV medication to 20 million people in poor countries. Stopping these medications can eventually kill or lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Through executive order, Trump withdrew the US from the WHO, ending decades of our international collaboration on healthcare. A gag on health agencies ability to communicate with the public, the possible freeze on federal grants, the anticipated cuts to programs that do not align with Trump’s ideological priorities, and (as of publication time) possible Senate confirmation of vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the nation’s healthcare system, are all worrying signs that this administration is a threat to accurate health information and equitable access to healthcare services. That’s true for straight people as well. Trump revoked Biden’s executive orders that directed the federal government to protect access to abortion. For queer Americans who grew up in an era of widely available, government-subsidized drugs to prevent and treat HIV infections, waiting for a treatment that may never come as friends, lovers, and gay rights pioneers sickened and died is nearly unfathomable. People lived for years without knowing HIV caused AIDS. They lived 15 years without a truly effective drug, by which time the virus had killed at least 343,000 people in the US. For much of that time, gay people still lacked many fundamental rights and contended with federal and local government officials indifferent to their suffering. Sodomy was still illegal in many states, and public opinion was not with gays. The Christian right saw gays as physically and spiritually contaminated, and AIDS as biblical justice. Still, people with AIDS gave the last weeks, months, and years of their lives working toward a future they might not see for people they would never meet. Their political courage was rewarded with one brighter than many could have imagined—for a time—but look where we are today. We should take lessons from the early AIDS activists who took matters into their own hands. The story of AIDS, and gay rights, is often told as David slew Goliath, that gay rights triumphed over bigotry and brought the government and its institutions to a heel. But for years, community response kept people safe. Alive. We now face the possibility of the government abandoning an even wider swath of the population. We’ve taken responsibility for our care before, and it worked. But it is not 1981. We need to decide what that looks like in 2025, keeping key lessons in mind: Progress is not linear, political victories are not final, and territory, once claimed, must be vigorously defended. Who you are can decide whether the government helps you, or potentially hurts you. When systems fail, help the people around you. Passivity and inaction are non-options. Small actions can be meaningful, even the smallest gestures, or simply occupying space. Sister Roma joined the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence in 1987 after a chance encounter at Midnight Sun, a bar in the Castro. In walked a character who looked like a showgirl nun. Gregarious, flirtatious, and smiling, Sister Luscious Lashes ordered a drink from a bartender she clearly knew. Roma thought she hadn’t seen anything like her when she walked over and called Roma by her “boy name,” which she never uses anymore. This nun was her good friend Norman Schrader. Sister Roma was ushered quickly into the order, and fell in love. Looking back to her years in San Francisco before the Sisters, Roma said she acted like she was in a “gay candy store,” where life revolved around partying and boys. “I must have been insufferable,” she says. “But when I met the Sisters, it was like my head exploded. I was like, ‘Oh my God, I care about my civil rights. I care about my community. I want to help people’ Even though I was raised sort of Catholic and went to a Catholic college, never was I raised to have any kind of spirituality or be of service until I met these crazy fucking drag queen nuns.” Schrader later died. But Roma and other Sisters continued patrolling the Castro, putting condoms in the hands of strangers in bars. They sought sick people, hunched over cocktails in the dark, and engaged them in conversation. Sometimes these men would ask for hugs. The Sisters always said yes.",,"['homelessness', 'parks']",3.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.325792,14274

It’s Seattle’s own, first-in-the-nation public campaign financing program. And Proposition 1 asks if we want to renew the levy that funds it for another decade. The new levy would be funded through a property tax, and it’s expected to raise $45 million over 10 years, costing the average homeowner $12.20 a year. By most metrics, the DVP has been a roaring success. It makes primaries more competitive and campaigning accessible to more diverse candidates, and the vast majority of people running for office in Seattle participate in the program. More than 106,000 Seattleites have slipped their vouchers to candidates, and according to the City, through 2024, we’ve distributed more than $10 million to local campaigns. It’s difficult to find opponents to the DVP (the opposition statement is written by right-wing radio host Ari Hoffman). But supporters of the program still have complaints. The most common concern is that when we introduced the Democracy Voucher Program (which limits the amount of money a candidate can accept), spending from lobbyists skyrocketed (which remained unlimited). But lobbying spending has shot up across the region, not just here in Seattle. And even if it did push lobbyists to up their game, it's also one of the few tools we have to combat them. There’s a reason that there isn’t any organized opposition to Proposition 1. It’s a new, promising program that deserves time to shake out its minimal kinks and prove to other cities that it’s worth it. Our democracy is already under attack. Now isn’t the time to defund one of the projects that makes democracy just a little bit more accessible. Vote yes on Proposition 1.",,['candidate'],3.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.326793,1935

Nicholas Matthew, 29, is charged with attempted murder after investigators say he randomly attacked a woman who was walking alone on a trail in the park on the afternoon of Feb. 10, 2024. PREVIOUS COVERAGE | Trial for man accused in brutal stabbing of woman at Point Defiance Park set to begin During her testimony, the victim told the jury she initially felt safe walking alone in the park that day as it was a nice day out and there were several people around, including families, all out enjoying the day. She described how she felt the suspect close to her and heard his footsteps running up behind her as she was suddenly hit in the back of the head and stabbed multiple times. “He kept moving the knife back and forth, he got my face, and then I remember at one point, because I only had my teeth to fight with, I remember holding the knife in my teeth at one point just trying to get ahold of it,” the victim told the jury. “He kept holding the knife at my throat, and it felt like he was trying to get to an artery, and he was saying, ‘Now tilt your head back so I can end your pain, you need to meet your maker.’” ""I started screaming, ‘He’s going to kill me, he’s killing me’ repeatedly,"" the victim told the jury. Multiple witnesses were able to stop the attack after hearing the victim's screams for help, but the suspect got away. “I remember he had turned back towards me, and I was bracing myself for the next impact when suddenly he was off of me,” the victim said. “I just suddenly had his weight leave, and I think I finally realized I was going to make it.” The victim told the jury she had over a dozen stab wounds to her head and also had multiple stab wounds to her face, shoulder, and back. Her ear was also slashed in half, and she was hospitalized for four days, requiring surgery and 150 staples to her wounds. Graphic photos of her injuries after the attack were also shown in court. The victim described some of the injuries to her face, saying, “There was carving from my right eye all the way down my cheek to my neck.” Items from the crime scene were processed by the Washington State Patrol crime lab and returned a match in the CODIS database for Matthew. Investigators were later able to catch Matthew at San Francisco International Airport as he was trying to leave the country. Court records indicate the suspect has a history of mental health issues, having previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia and depression, and reportedly experiencing psychosis and hallucinations in the past. According to his forensic psychological evaluation filed with the court in June, Matthew spent 5.5 months at Western State Hospital to restore his competency to stand trial. However, in June, a doctor cleared Matthew to stand trial, writing in Matthew’s evaluation, “He has not presented with overt symptoms of mental illness and has generally presented with stable mood, no hallucinations or delusions, no signs of mania, and organized thinking.” Though Matthew has chosen to represent himself, the court has appointed an attorney to help Mathew as standby counsel, which is standard procedure. On the first day of trial, jurors also heard from first responders who arrived at the scene, including a paramedic from the Tacoma Fire Department (TFD) and a Tacoma Police officer. “She was screaming in agony, blood was splattered all over her clothes, nearby in the grass, I saw two witnesses hovering above her trying to render aid,” TPD Officer Ryan Naylor said. TFD Lt. Aaron Combs told the jury the victim’s heart rate dropped to 50 bpm at one point as she was being transported to the hospital. Matthew declined to give an opening statement or cross-examine any of the witnesses so far, as he continues to represent himself in his own defense. KOMO News spoke with the victim, Victoria Nizzoli, after her testimony Tuesday, who shared she was prepared for the scenario should Matthew choose to directly ask her questions during cross-examination. ""I suddenly had to focus so much more on my own inner strength and focusing on the fact that I get to leave at the end of the day, and he does not,"" Nizzoli said. ""And this won't be the thing that breaks me."" ""It is really hard to think about how before all this I did feel very independent, like I could go out and just do things, like I could walk the trail,"" she also shared. ""For him to have taken that away from me, I just felt so much anger and frustration that he was in the same room with me that he knows what he's done."" The trial is expected to last about two weeks. Jurors are expected to hear from witnesses who heard the victim’s screams and stepped in to help, as well as the trauma surgeon who treated the victim as she arrived at the hospital. However, it does not appear that jurors will not hear about the defendant’s history of mental health issues. ""The defense has not endorsed an expert witness to testify regarding the defendant’s mental health prior to or at the time of this incident,"" pre-trial court documents state.",,"['police', 'fire department']",3.0,2025-08-05T19:12:18.850414,5344
https://www.thestranger.com/queer/2024/12/17/79829246/aclu-sues-washington-doc-for-confining-trans-woman-to-mens-prison,The Stranger (Web),ACLU Sues Washington DOC for Confining Trans Woman to Men’s Prison Just Can't Get Enough?,"The ACLU of Washington is suing the Washington Department of Corrections, alleging it violated a transgender woman’s constitutional rights under state law by forcibly transferring her from a women’s prison to confine her in a men’s prison. The transfer occurred after a guard discovered her engaging in consensual sex with her roommate. On Tuesday, the organization filed a Personal Restraint Petition on behalf of Amber Kim, arguing that placing her in a men’s prison, where she is more likely to experience harassment and sexual violence is cruel under state constitutional standards. The petition requests that the state transfer her back to the Washington Corrections Center for Women. ""DOC has stripped her of her humanity by taking her from the women's prison, where she was really, truly excelling, and put her in a place that we know will harm her, both physically and emotionally,"" says ACLU of Washington staff attorney Adrien Leavitt. ""She has a history of physical abuse, sexual abuse, harassment, and emotional abuse in the men's prisons. We know that from studies that trans people are at huge risk of all of those things. It's not, sadly, like we're not guessing about whether that will happen to Amber, because we know it's already happened to her."" The Washington DOC said that they do not comment on pending litigation. This March, an officer at Washington Corrections Center for Women (WCCW) in Gig Harbor discovered Kim and her roommate having consensual sex in their cell, which is against prison rules. The women were removed from their cell, separated, and placed in restrictive housing. At a disciplinary hearing, both Kim and her roommate were found guilty of a “504 Infraction,” a prison ban on intimacy. As punishment, both women were placed in closed custody, adding supervision and confining them to cells for longer than usual. Then, someone at the DOC leaked Kim’s disciplinary report to the conservative National Review, which published an account that played on sensational, right-wing tropes of trans women using their identity to get into bathrooms, changing rooms, and prisons for sexual gratification. (In March, the DOC said it was trying to find the leaker). Her life was less salacious. The infraction was her first and only write-up in the three-and-a-half years she lived at WCCW, where she attended college and tutored other inmates. Documents show Kim’s mental health improved after her transfer, and she reported other inmates treated her like any other woman. She told counselors she no longer wanted to give up on life. Here the women’s punishments diverged. Months after her roommate left closed custody, Amber remained anxiously waiting without explanation. Her fears were realized when a DOC counselor allegedly told her the DOC was considering transferring her back to a men’s prison, a move the department had never made before. DOC policy allows it to remove inmates from gender-affirming housing if there are “documented, objective safety concerns.” After the infraction, a multidisciplinary team at WCCW reviewed Kim’s housing placement. WCCW Superintendent Charlotte Headley and others determined Kim should remain at the women’s facility, finding she was neither abused or an abuser in her time there. Five weeks later, the DOC reversed its decision. The DOC only adopted its trans housing policy in 2020, and since then only 11 out of the roughly 250 trans people in the system had entered gender-affirming housing. The DOC allows trans people to stay where they are if they want to—some have communities and relationships worth keeping—but the transfers are not a given, and granted on a case-by-case basis with fuzzy parameters. 504 Infractions are not uncommon, and sex is a reality of prison life. The DOC recorded 33 in the years Kim lived at WCCW, but she remains the only person transferred for one, and the only trans person in Washington removed from gender-affirming housing. On June 21, when corrections officers restrained Kim with a seatbelt-like device for a two-hour ride to Monroe Correctional Complex, where she arrived exhausted and unable to stand. According to the lawsuit, officers claimed Kim had tried to bite them, but rescinded the allegation after video evidence obtained by Disability Rights Washington showed she hadn’t. When Kim arrived at Monroe, she learned the DOC planned to place her in TRU, a unit of primarily sex offenders, former gang members, and a small number of transgender women. Fearing for her safety, Kim went on a 17-day hunger strike, only suspending it for a gender-affirming tracheal shave. How the DOC May Have Violated Kim’s Rights The ACLU’s case draws from Robert Rufus Williams’s 2021 case before the Washington State Supreme Court, which sought relief from cruel conditions in the height of COVID. Leavitt says the Williams case in particular set an important precedent when it found that Washington’s State Constitution provides greater protections than the United States Constitution. In this case, Kim is sentenced to life without parole for murdering her parents. The ACLU argues that when statistics and Kim’s life experience shows harassment and the threat of sexual violence are omnipresent in male prisons, confining her to one violates her state constitutional right, without a valid penalogical reason to do so. Leavitt says the DOC may have a goal of tightening prison security, but housing Kim with men does not accomplish that. Statistics support Amber’s own documented history, showing the elevated risk for trans women in men’s prisons and jails. The Bureau of Justice’s 2015 National Inmate Survey found 35 percent of trans people in prison, and 34 percent of trans people in jail had been sexually assaulted within a year of their incarceration. It also found transgender inmates were nine times more likely to experience sexual harassment and assault than cis inmates. The US Trans Survey, the largest dataset of trans people in the US available, found trans inmates were five times more likely to be sexually assaulted by prison staff, and nine times more likely to be sexually assaulted by inmates. Thirty-seven percent of incarcerated trans people self-reported that they were assaulted in prison, compared with 3.4 percent of the cis population. The Prison Rape Elimiation Act even contains specific protections for gay and trans people. These statistics are not hypothetical for Kim, who has been incarcerated since she was a senior in high school. Even before her transition, Kim was slim and feminine. Men taunted her with slurs. After her transition, they propositioned her. At one point, she says men had passed her enough notes asking for sex to fill a brown paper lunch bag. Most of these notes included a time the men would be waiting for Kim in the showers. She kept track of these times to avoid running into them. When Kim complained to a job supervisor in prison that a coworker, convicted of sex offense, was aggressively pressuring her for sex, she was fired, according to the lawsuit. Male corrections officers allegedly inappropriately touched her breasts during pat downs. According to the suit, she eventually reported her experiences saying that she did not “feel safe” in a men’s prison. She still doesn’t. In August, during a transfer from Monroe Correctional Complex to Airway Heights for a gender-affirming procedure, male inmates yelled sexual comments and slurs from the seats behind her. Others debated the existence of trans people. Upon her return to Monroe, Kim told DOC she would not enter the general population, where she would face a Catch-22. Hormones alleviate her debilitating gender dysphoria, but the more feminine she becomes, the more unwanted attention men would give her. Years before the Williams case, the US Supreme Court found that the Eighth Amendment protects incarcerated people from cruel and unusual punishment. In 1989, Dee Farmer, a Black trans woman imprisoned in Terre Haute, Indiana was brutally beaten and raped in her cell. She sued prison officials for mental anguish, psychological damage, and humiliation. The justices ruled unanimously in Farmer’s favor, finding prison officials created an “objectively intolerable risk of harm” and acted with “deliberate indifference to this harm.” In Farmer’s case, officials knowingly placed a young, non-violent trans woman to a maximum security prison, and disregarded that risk. According to the ACLU, tens of thousands of cases have cited Farmer. But “deliberate indifference” is hard to prove in court. In Washington, you don’t have to because this federal standard falls short of our state protections. The court decided this when Robert Rufus Williams brought his Personal Restraint Petition at the height of COVID, seeking relief from cruel conditions under the state constitution. Williams, a 77-year-old Black man with diabetes, hypertension, and complications from a stroke that immobilized his right side, had been kept in a “dry” cell without a toilet or sink. When waiting for staff to wheel him to an accessible bathroom, Williams urinated in bottles. He struggled to keep himself clean. This State Supreme Court found failing to meet Williams’s basic sanitary needs did not meet penological goals of retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation in violation of Article 1, section 14 of the Washington State Constitution. The justices also concluded that the “deliberate indifference” standard assumed that poor conditions can only be considered punishment if a prison official subjectively intended them as punishment, or that cruel conditions can arise from “institutional policies and practices just as readily as from intentional acts by individual prison officials.” This established a subjective, two-part inquiry for inmates challenging their conditions in Washington far more protective than the federal precedent set in Farmer v. Brennan. To be granted relief, the decision found, inmates must prove “(1) those conditions create an objectively significant risk of serious harm or otherwise deprive the petitioner of the basic necessities of human dignity and (2) those conditions are not reasonably necessary to accomplish any penological goal.” Since Williams, no one has been granted relief based on cruel conditions of confinement, and Kim’s case is likely the first to challenge how the DOC houses trans people on that standard. “What we can infer from the Washington State Supreme Court’s discussion of Dee Farmer’s case is that Washington State would not tolerate Dee Farmer’s conditions of confinement,” Leavitt says. “Our state would be more protective of her, and I think that’s profound, especially as we compare that with Amber’s case right now.” Kim’s Life in Isolation The degree to which Kim’s life has worsened can be measured in absolute terms: She’s gone from being a full-time college student with friends to sitting in solitary confinement. But it’s clearest in her voice. Her affect is flat over the phone in Leavitt’s office. She’s calling on a tablet from her cell. Every few sentences, the signal fizzles to an electronic garble. “I’m definitely feeling the weight of isolation,” she says. “I will not even pretend to be psychologically okay.” She can’t hug friends because she’s not allowed contact visits. She has three books and video games on her tablet, but lives mostly in isolation, cycling from her cell, to the shower, to the unit yard—a small concrete room with a chin-up bar. She believes other prisoners don’t know she’s there, as they’ve taken to harassing another trans woman in her cell block who catches “no end of shit.” As Kim told The Stranger this summer, the irony of forcing a trans woman into a men’s prison, supposedly to stop sex from happening, is that the life of a trans woman in a men’s prison is a barrage of sexual harassment and slurs. The abuse worsened as her transition progressed, and only wavered when she had a boyfriend, a calculated trade of sex for safety. This time, she’s traded freedom for safety. As she wrote in an affidavit, “If I am eventually placed in men’s general population, I will live in constant fear.”",,"['housing', 'policy']",3.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.328750,12157

Y’all, money is scary. Given the state of the world, I find myself oscillating between caring about financial stability as a potential way to feel safe, and pondering if the US will continue to exist long enough for the dollar to be of little more use than wallpaper. Even though this is a super weird time to think about your wallet, if you happen to be on the side of stability craving vs country escape plans, I’d love to share some clear, shame-free, and actionable financial basics. You’re not the only one who doesn’t understand money stuff. I sure as hell didn’t, and most don’t. That’s why we have crypto bros buying NFTs, grandparents mailing checks to TV salesmen, and high-powered financiers robbing us all. However, the more stability you build, the more power you’ll have to support your community and stand up for what matters. Disclaimer: Everything here is purely informational. Please do your own digging before making big decisions, and don’t come for me. I’m just some person who did a bunch of research and wanted to share what I learned for free so that folks don’t get p0wned by corporations. There’s also the sad fact that some people are just screwed by the system. I hope this advice helps, but none of it would be necessary if the government had woven social safety nets instead of an anti-social death pit. You have to work to make money. But when it’s in your pocket, its sole purpose should be to make you happy and align with your values. If it’s not doing that, some corporate scumbag has tricked you into running the rat race. Ask yourself two questions. What are 3 to 5 things that bring you joy on a regular basis? Doing the crossword with your partner? Giving belly rubs to the kitty-cat? Toasting your buns at Denny Blaine? What are 3 to 5 values, causes, or commitments that matter to you? Immigrant rights? Environmental justice? Personal freedom? Shoo-ing Stuart Sloan away from Denny Blaine? Seriously, make a list. Think of it as your compass. Each financial decision should point directly back to these. First, figure out how much you make and how much you spend. If you don’t know, you’re not alone, but the first step of financial planning is getting those numbers down. For income, gather your pay stubs and bank statements. For expenses, card users can utilize aggregators like Yodlee. Cash people, commit to manually tracking your receipts. Either way, you’ll want at least three months of data to review. Once you’ve crunched those numbers, ask yourself a deeper question: Does my spending align with my values? Compare your values with each one of last month’s expenses. Then do it again. Look for patterns. Springing for a newspaper subscription is a good choice if your daily joy is the crossword. If the perfect morning starts with black coffee, and supporting immigrant rights is a core value, going to the Vietnamese-owned café down the block is money well spent. But if you’re dropping $300 a month on Uber rides while “environmental justice” is literally on your values list … reconsider. (Also: Buses exist. They vibrate. It’s kinda like a massage.) Reflecting isn’t about guilt. It’s about alignment. Don’t punish yourself for past decisions. Evaluate with open eyes and move forward. Compound interest is the single most important concept in personal finance. For real, don’t glaze over this section because it has numbers. Everything clicks into place once you get it. But beware: It can be your friend or a bitter foe. When compound interest plays nice, your money earns money—and then that money earns more money. Pretty cool. Imagine you have $1000. If you invest that and it returns 10% per year, you’ll have $1,100 after a year. But next year, you don’t just earn another $100—you earn $110, because now you’re earning interest on the accumulated $1,100. After year 2, you’ve made $1,210. Now for the magic: Wait 10 years and the original $1000 has compounded to $2,593.74. You’ve done nothing but played the same game the 1% has played for generations. Time and percentages are the secret ingredients. The sooner you start, the more powerful it becomes. Now for a walk on the evil side. Free money. That was exciting. But let’s say you have $5,000 in credit card debt at 24% APR (which is extremely typical). Let’s not pay any of it for ten years. Holy shit. We’ve accumulated over $50k in interest—on top of the original $5,000. Y’all, that’s literally insane! Big financial institutions are crushing ordinary people with interest. How steeply debt climbs is directly associated with the “APR” that credit cards hide by offering the first year at 0%. Every month you carry a balance, the debt compounds. It’s like an investment … but into a financial pit. Personal rant: 24% interest rates should literally be illegal. Someone please work on that. By now, you may be panic-reflecting on your situation. Breathe. If you have high-interest debts like credit card balances, it’s budget time. Take your fixed expenses (food, rent, utilities, transit) and evaluate where you can trim costs (can we sell the car and bike instead?). After you’ve done your best, consider what else can be cut. Can you sub things for low-cost or free alternatives that still support your values and happiness? Try swapping expensive habits for low-budget or free alternatives. Buy more books than you have time to read? Snag a library card. Do this enough and you’ll save without feeling like you’re missing out. Budgeting isn’t about suffering. It’s about prioritizing what matters. We’re aiming for a sustainable, steady path toward debt elimination that preserves your dignity and happiness. Go too hard and you’ll end up in an unstable self-denial/indulgence cycle. It’s a simple formula: Emergency Fund Amount = 3–6 x Monthly Expenses. If you spend $2K a month, aim to save $6K–$12K, after you’ve taken care of your debt. This is not your vacation fund. It’s your “sleep good” starter pack for job loss, unexpected bills, and life’s “holy shit” moments. It is also a “fuck you fund” if your job conflicts with your values. Put it in a boring, easily accessible savings account. If you want to beat inflation—invest. But only if you have sent any high-interest debts back to hell and have money you won’t need for five to 10 years. I recommend low-cost index funds like VTSAX, or other similar ones. An index fund is a simple way to invest in the entire market—your money gets split across tons of companies, based on their value, like a big capitalist smoothie. So instead of buying a single Tesla stock and praying Elon doesn’t tweet something unhinged at 3 am, you’re investing in all the companies and hoping if one company falls, the rest will balance it out. The “expense ratios” on these should be well below 0.2%. If not, run! If you want to keep your money out of evildoers like BP, look into “ESG”s, which are managed funds that attempt to weed out companies that go against certain core principles. You’re not trying to beat the market like your crypto-crazed Uncle Geoff. You’re trying to get in on its long-term growth. Big disclaimer: The market swings wildly, but has historically gone up given enough time. Just leave your investments alone! Retirement Accounts: It’s Just Investing With Extra Steps They’re like government-labeled, tax-advantaged jars for your investments. Each one has different rules. Your employer might offer a matched 401(k). Freelancers can consider IRAs (not that IRA, unless…). You can open one of these on your own and even roll over 401(k) funds from old jobs, but regardless, remember to have them all invested in low-cost index funds! Finances can feel a bit like Monopoly. But it ain’t. So please remember to give back. Pick a percentage of your yearly income (even 1% is a start) and, if you can, give consistently. Support causes, people, movements, mutual aid. You don’t have to be rich to give.",,['budget'],2.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.308168,7959

Experts believe a Mount Rainier eruption would post a grave threat to millions who live in the southern and eastern sections of the Seattle metropolitan area. La Nina is the opposing end of the spectrum from El Nino, an oscillation between cooler and warmer than normal waters in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Here's a look at how the Northwest Avalanche Center's team of forecasters determines the daily risk of avalanches in Washington's Cascades. The National Weather Service predicts El Niño conditions to persist through the upcoming spring, and that changes what we can expect this winter in the PNW. It is 95% certain that El Niño will occur for January 2024 through February and March 2024. There is a 71% probability it will be classified as a strong one.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2024/12/23/79838343/the-washington-grown-legal-powerhouse-coming-for-lgbtq-rights,The Stranger (Web),The Washington-Grown “Legal Powerhouse” Coming for LGBTQ Rights Just Can't Get Enough?,"Earlier this month, in a feature in the Gay Times, Uncloseted Media introduced many of their readers to Kristen Waggoner, one of the world’s leaders in anti-LGBTQ and anti-choice advocacy, and fighter for “religious freedom.” She was presented—for very good reason—as a “legal powerhouse” in the conservative movement, with more than a decade of success attacking queer and reproductive rights in the courts, a key driver of Trump’s anti-LGBTQ movement, and by some observers’ estimations, a member of Trump’s shortlist for the Supreme Court. Underneath this flurry of conservative bonafides, though, there’s one detail that’s easy to miss: She built the foundation for that work right here in the Pacific Northwest. Today, Waggoner is the CEO of the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF), a Christian legal advocacy group founded by some 30 members of the Christian Right. If you’re unfamiliar with the organization, it’s helpful to imagine them as the religious right’s answer to the ACLU. As of last year, they had an annual operating budget of $102 million dollars. They fund potential precedent-setting cases that have constitutional implications, offer training programs for young lawyers who want to work for Christian causes, and run a global wing of their operation that, among other things, has advocated for making gay sex illegal between consenting adults. It should come as no surprise that the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated them as a hate group. Waggoner has led the ADF through its most prolific, most effective, most damaging era. But before she rose to the national stage, she was a Christian Right underdog in a sea of progressivism, fighting the fight at a “boutique” law firm in downtown Seattle. Waggoner started her journey in Longview, WA—a town along the Columbia River, right on the border to Oregon—and she fancied herself an underdog from day one. In an interview with podcaster David Lat, she described her town as having “a lot of diverse views—maybe not as diverse as they used to be, because they’re barreling hard left in a number of respects.” She described herself and her father as “first-generation Christians” surrounded by a much more left-leaning family. Her father was a superintendent at a Christian school, and she said she witnessed “government overreach” in the school (presumably meaning that the State wanted the school to meet Washington’s accreditation standards—often a challenge for religious schools). In that same podcast with Lat, she explained that her dad “felt pretty strongly early on that I had a vocational call on my life.” By 12 or 13 years old, she said, she knew that she was “called to go into law and to protect religious freedom.” She attended a small Christian college in Kirkland and then went to Regent University for law school because it was the only accredited Christian law school in the country. Her career launched on a pretty standard track, clerking for Washington State Supreme Court Justice Richard B. Sanders, a relatively liberal member of the Libertarian party who voted to uphold a ban on gay marriage. But her next job brings us to a law firm that I’ve had my eye on for a long time: Ellis, Li, and McKinstry PLLC, otherwise known as ELM Law. Waggoner describes them as a “boutique law firm” in downtown Seattle, which is true. They describe themselves as a small, client-oriented firm “built on listening so intently to the needs of businesses and individuals that the common distractions of the legal system fall quiet.” That may be true, too. But the reason I’ve been watching them for the last few years, is that they’ve been representing ADF cases in Washington state for the last decade. Waggoner spent 15 years there, eventually becoming a partner in the firm. And it was there that she discovered her “purpose.” Waggoner’s lightbulb moment is actually an era that Washingtonians might remember. It started in 2012. “I began to feel a growing sense of restlessness—that my faith was prompting me to be the ‘risk taker,’” Waggoner told the Conservateur years later. “At the time, I was lead counsel in a case called Stormans, where Washington state was trying to force pharmacy owners to dispense early abortifacients.” By “abortifacients,” of course, she means Plan B. Then in 2013, a gay couple in Richland, in southern Washington, sued Arlene’s Flowers after she refused to provide flowers for their wedding, citing the usual deeply held Christian beliefs. Both of these cases were ultimately championed by the ADF, but on the ground here in Washington—like many of the ADF’s cases—it was handled by ELM Law. And specifically, they were led by Waggoner. “Those two cases prompted me to get involved in pro-bono advocacy full-time,” Waggoner said. She joined the ADF, and the rest is “legal powerhouse” history. The ADF has seen 15 Supreme Court victories in the last 12 years. Recently, you might have heard of: Masterpiece Cakeshop v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which determined by a 7-2 vote that the bakery couldn’t be compelled to make a cake for a gay wedding if it violated the owner’s religious beliefs; 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, which did the same for wedding websites; and Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade. Waggoner has been the lead attorney on every one of those cases, driving the movement to reshape American civil liberties in a Christian image. The first Trump administration gave the ADF a huge leg up in their federal cases, and as we head into a new Trump administration, the ADF is supporting dozens of anti-LGBTQ cases currently moving through the lower courts. In the Uncloseted Media profile, they note that because Waggoner hasn’t had any experience on the bench, she’s not a likely Supreme Court pick—not yet, anyway. At least one expert that they spoke to thought it was possible Trump could appoint her to a lower court for a bit before promoting her, giving the ADF unprecedented control of our legal landscape. “It feels a bit like we’re David against Goliath,” she said of ADF's work. “Yet we know how that story ends.”",,['budget'],2.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.314209,6100

Prosecutors say Gregory William Timm, 32, shot Harold James Powell in the chest during an altercation on July 31 outside the Starbucks at 1101 Alaskan Way. Timm accused Powell of “stolen valor” and demanded proof of his military service before allegedly shooting him with a .45 caliber handgun. According to police and witness accounts detailed in the charging documents, Timm approached Powell, who was sitting in his wheelchair, and removed a military patch from his belongings. Timm then insisted that Powell provide identification proving his veteran status. Powell reportedly responded by retrieving a knife from a bag on his wheelchair, prompting further demands from Timm to see ID. Powell also had a holstered airsoft gun that resembled a real firearm, though witnesses said Powell never removed it or pointed it at Timm. Before Powell could act, Timm allegedly pulled a handgun from a shoulder bag, stepped back about 12 feet, and fired once into Powell’s chest, according to video evidence reviewed by detectives. After the shooting, Timm continued shouting at Powell to show his ID and accused him of pulling a gun. Timm then placed his weapon back in his bag and raised his hands before being detained by a Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife officer who had heard the gunshot and was nearby. Seattle police arrived shortly after and took custody of Timm. Officers recovered the handgun and read him his Miranda rights. According to court documents, Timm admitted the gun was his and did not deny shooting Powell. While in the back of a patrol car, Timm said unprompted, “This guy pulled out a gun and said, ‘You’re not gonna run from this.’” Powell was taken to Harborview Medical Center with a gunshot wound to the chest. In a brief hospital interview, he told detectives that he had been trying to make a few dollars—as he often did in that location—when Timm confronted him and shot him as he reached for his veteran ID. Timm has no known prior criminal history. Bail was set at $750,000. Timm is charged with first-degree assault, which in Washington state involves intentionally inflicting great bodily harm using a deadly weapon. ©2025 Cox Media Group","August 05, 2025 at 3:34 pm PDT August 05, 2025 at 3:34 pm PDT",['police'],2.0,2025-08-05T19:12:18.848329,2433

https://www.kiro7.com/news/local/wa-wineries-hit-by-18-sales-decline-over-past-3-years/L5RAA65WCNG4XJ2TWKURQUO4H4/,KIRO 7,WA wineries hit by 18% sales decline over past 3 years,"This story was originally published on MyNorthwest.com Wine sales in Washington have recorded a substantial drop in recent years, down more than 18% since 2021, according to the Puget Sound Business Journal. Washington wineries sold more than 13.54 million cases of wine to customers in 2021. Last year, only 11.1 million cases were sold, an 18.2% decrease in sales. The more than 2 million wine case sales decrease represents approximately 30 million fewer bottles of wine sold in Washington over three years. The deflated sales are not exclusive to Washington, as wine revenue was down 6.3% year over year across the nation in 2024. “There’s a little bit of that anti-alcohol movement. Then we’re also seeing so many new products enter into the alcoholic beverage category – ready-to-drink cocktails, hard seltzers, there’s so many more options that consumer has,” Kristina Kelley, executive director of Washington State Wine Commission, told the Puget Sound Business Journal. “Particularly, as Gen Z comes into wine, they’re buying less.” The total number of wineries in Washington has also dramatically increased between 2019 and 2020, expanding from 50 to 1,050. In 2022, the number of wineries peaked at 1,070, before dropping down to 1,050 in 2024. A sales decline was recorded at 47% of Washington wineries last year, according to the Puget Sound Business Journal. Kelley mentioned she believes Washington is a highly reputable wine-producing state and is hopeful that the industry can grow into a competitive industry, both nationally and internationally. “We welcome outside investors coming into our state. We welcome when we see California producers coming in and purchasing things,” Kelley said, according to the Puget Sound Business Journal. “We welcome those opportunities. And we think there’s still room to grow.” In terms of wine production in the U.S., Washington ranks second, behind only California. Washington has more than 400 grape growers, and harvested 150,828 tons of grapes last year. The Washington wine industry employs more than 67,000 workers, and generates an estimated $10.56 billion in annual in-state economic impact, the Puget Sound Business Journal stated.

The rally brought together more than 1,000 protesters at Cal Anderson Park, and then, with the assistance of car escorts and bike blockades, they marched to the federal building, stretching across blocks at a time. And it wasn't the only protest in the region. At the same time, 200 lawyers were ceremonially retaking their oath at the King County Superior Court, and immigrant advocates were marching on the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma. There are May Day protests in every major city every year, but this year, they drew from the same kind of energy—even on a Thursday—that the Hands Off! protests harnessed in April. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators protested across the country. This is the kind of progressive coalition building we need. Earlier this month, Stranger columnist Kendall Turner asked social scientists if we know what makes a successful protest movement. She wrote that “we know that over the last century, almost no protest movement that has mobilized 3.5 percent of a population has failed to achieve its goals.” Hands Off! didn’t hit those numbers—the highest estimates were 1 percent of the population—and neither did yesterday’s, but gatherings like these are how we build the foundation to get to that 3.5 percent. “Few things stop a movement’s momentum as quickly as not having something to do next,” wrote Turner. “Numbers matter, yes, but so does consistency in participation in a protest movement.” Stranger contributing photographer Brittne Lunniss captured it all, so if you weren’t able to make it, here’s a little taste of the magic.

This drag queen got dragged. She got back up, dusted herself off, and now it’s time for vindication. She brought glamour to the land of grunge. First Luly Yang became THE designer for custom bridal gowns and high fashion. Then, she took on work uniforms for the masses. She did not design the mistake that nearly brought her down, but she learned enough from it to survive when fashion stood still. She was an astronaut, an International Space Station alum, and an aquanaut before she turned 40. It all happened because she got stumped by a high school student asking about going to the bathroom. The New York Times calls him the “Nerd King of Internet Cooking. You could also call him a bestselling cookbook author, a social media star, and food critic. In this episode of “Hit and Miss with Monique Ming Laven,” Kenji Lopez-Alt talks about being an MIT grad who did nothing with his degree, a person who made a bad decision on Twitter, and a cook who committed a jaw-dropping mistake with a plunger and pasta. Forged by fire, that’s how Daniel Lyon describes his story. His fire engine was engulfed by the 2015 Twisp Fire. He was the only one who survived, and there were times he wished he hadn’t. Now, after more than 100 surgeries, burns over 70 percent of his body, and a lifetime of rehab still ahead, he takes responsibility for a mistake that he says changed his life. Deborah Horne has been recording history for decades – from Rosa Parks to housewives picketing their husbands. She talks frankly about the mistakes and challenges along the way, including how she became a doctor and made a very famous patient cry. You’ve known Deborah Horne for decades, but you haven’t known her like this. Rick Steves like you’ve never heard him before– on the piano and on the Hippie Trail. He’s now the definitive go-to guide for Europe – but he actually found his calling on the way to Kathmandu. Listen to his hit and miss journey to success that includes a whole lot of mistakes, multiple brushes with death, and the loss of his marijuana virginity in Afghanistan. Sports is about a lot more than wins and losses. Ask any kid who’s trying to find a way to fit in – including a young Pat Chun. Now, as UW Athletics Director, he’s at the top of his field, but along the way, he’s had to confront suicide, a controversial trip across the Cascades, and a rejection from home. But at least he has the piece of paper that convinced his mom he’s not a failure. Molly Moon Neitzel champions ice cream and progressive politics, but she did not reach success in one fell scoop. She reveals a story that includes Republican business-owning grandparents, failed political campaigns, tragic personal loss, and a mistake on the mic that she truly regrets. Boys in the Boat put a global spotlight on the University of Washington. Even Hollywood royalty came calling. In this inaugural episode, Daniel James Brown tells Monique Ming Laven how an early life failure almost sank his career before it even began, and how Microsoft, Harvey Weinstein, and George Clooney were all part of his “Hit and Miss” journey. But it really began with a teenage decision - a mistake he thought would ruin his life.",,"['parks', 'parks (title)']",1.5,2025-08-05T19:12:18.833017,3299

Firefighters in western Canada believe they know what sparked a brush fire — a bird and a fish. Ashcroft Fire Rescue shared photos of a charred fish on the ground near the brush fire that burned near the town. Investigators think an osprey caught a fish and got tired, dropping it on powerlines, sparking the blaze, The Associated Press reported. They said that the closest river to where the fire started was about 2 miles away and that the fish was large and the temperatures were high. The incident not only sparked the fire, it also knocked out power to the town, the AP reported. In a post on social media, the fire department had a more far-fetched theory, that the osprey was “tired of raw fish and wanted to give cooked a try,” The New York Times reported.

The order is blocked for the next 14 days. King, a Biden appointee, said Trump’s executive order intended to erase transgender people and “blatantly discriminated against trans youth.” The decision came less than 24 hours after a judge in Maryland temporarily blocked the order nationwide. King believed that Trump’s executive order—titled “Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation”— was not likely to “survive judicial scrutiny” because it subverted the power of Congress to distribute money for potentially lifesaving gender-affirming care and violated equal protection under the 5th Amendment by not funding trans health care, while continuing to fund the same, or similar treatments, for cisgender children. Judge King’s temporary restraining order comes exactly one week after Washington Attorney General Nick Brown sued over Trump’s order. As AG Brown said at a news conference announcing the suit, the order not only threatened to defund hospitals and research institutions that provided this care, but possibly prosecute providers. Transgender people across the country have lost care because doctors and hospitals took those threats seriously, including Seattle Children’s Hospital, which last week postponed a trans teen’s masculinizing top surgery the night before it was scheduled, attracting protest from trans people, parents of trans kids, and their supporters. During the hearing, Washington Deputy Solicitor General Tera Heintz argued Trump’s order was “open and unapologetic bigotry” that rejected the overwhelming medical consensus that gender-affirming care is safe and effective for children. She read comments from a plaintiff in the case, a doctor who has treated hundreds of trans children, and remains anonymous for fear of retribution.“There are going to be young people who take their lives if they can no longer receive this care,” she read. “Without access to this care, transgender adolescents will die—I am certain of it.” Heintz said the states’ lawyers had introduced a mound of evidence showing how gender-affirming care, introduced in slow and deliberate stages, drastically improved children’s lives, Heintz said. Heintz also said that this order reads as an implict threat to providers because it equates all trans care to “chemical and surgical mutilation,” and asks the Department of Justice to review and prioritize laws against female genital mutilation, or the cutting, sewing, or removal of the labia or clitoris for non-medical reasons. Now it was the government’s burden to prove, with evidence, that it is the mutilation it claims it is. It could not. The government’s lawyer, Vinita Andrapalliyal, argued the President had the constitutional authority to direct his agency heads to take appropriate next steps on a “policy preference.” It is possible the order “could be implemented lawfully,” she said, and until an agency revoked any grant, the court did not have to decide, and should wait to see how this “shakes out.” Her argument fell apart a few minutes later when Judge King started asking simple questions, like: Were all the treatments as “irreversible” as the order claimed they were? “No, I don’t think we specifically say one way or the other—” Vinita Andrapalliyal said. “I’m asking you today,” King interjected. “I don’t—I don’t know, I’m here today—” “You have not looked into it.” “I’m here within the lawfulness of the executive order—” “This is part of it,” King said. “Do you have any evidence that all of the treatments listed in the executive order are irreversible?” Andrapalliyal said she had evidence of the President’s policy prerogative to not fund the “so-called transition of a child from one sex to another.” “But we’re looking at goals here—irreversible treatment is central to the goals. You haven’t looked into that at all. You don’t have an answer for me today.” This carried on for 13 more excruciating minutes. When King asked for an example of the order targeting similar treatment for cisgender people, there was a thirty second pause. When King asked if the government would allow doctors to prescribe puberty blockers, a drug given to both cisgender and transgender children to delay the onset of puberty, to a cisgender boy with prostate cancer, while disallowing doctors from giving the same medication to a transgender girl with the same condition, there was another long pause. After disagreement about the meaning of the text, Andrapalliyal reiterated that the President is asking his agencies to take next steps consistent with the law, and they don’t yet know those steps. King posed another hypothetical: A recently married, 18-year-old cisgender man with Huntington’s Disease gets a vasectomy because he does not want to pass it onto his children. Was that included in the government’s refusal to support the alteration or removal of an individual’s sex organs to “minimize or destroy their natural biological functions?” “I don’t know,” Andrapalliyal said. “Can you read the text and let me know what you think?” King asked. Another pause, which like the others, was filled with snickering from an obviously queer audience. (Before the hearing, activists had circulated a flier encouraging people to “pack the court.” At 9:20, forty minutes before the hearing, the line for security nearly snaked out the door. Every seat was taken, even in the overflow room.) “I’m not a medical provider,” Andrapalliyal said. “If you can’t figure it out—how is a medical provider supposed to know that?” King said. “This is not a medical text. This is an executive order.” After back and forth of when and how medical providers were supposed to determine a person’s birth sex, for which Andrapalliyal had no answers, she said there were a lot of unknowns. “Medical providers have no direction on where to go because you can’t read the text and apply it to various facts,” King said, sharply exhaling. “This is extremely frustrating, counsel.” At courthouse steps, a reporter asked AG Brown what he thought of this exchange. “A bit embarrassing,” he said to laughter and applause, but he later turned serious. “I want to remind people that the Department of Justice was created to defend civil rights,” he said. “What we’re seeing from this President is a specific undermining of its purpose, a specific directive to no longer defend civil rights, and it is upsetting to me, personally and professionally.” Indigo, a nonbinary person who responded to the activist call to “pack the court,” said it was important to show up in numbers to support the community, even just to be a “body in a room.” They’re also Asian-American, and went through the “whole China virus thing” during COVID-19, so they knew how Trump’s comments could galvanize people with bigoted views to take violent action. Standing in the courtyard outside, Danni Askini, executive director of the Seattle-based trans advocacy organization Gender Justice League, wondered if the “shock and awe” effect of the Trump Administration is their “own undoing.” “They’ve pushed so much stuff down on the Department of Justice, and they’re firing people left and right,” she says. “Who wants to work in a politicized law firm like the DOJ as it is now? I really feel for the Assistant US Attorney who argued the case.” After all, the DOJ essentially failed to make the same case twice this week. On Thursday, US District Judge Brendan Hurson of Maryland also issued a temporary restraining order blocking Trump’s order. During the hearing, Hurson said he was skeptical that the government’s order was not effectively banning care nationwide by threatening to pull funding from hospitals and research institutions that provide or study transgender care for youth and young adults. Patients had received phone calls stopping care, stopping their appointments, stopping their “everything,” he said. “I don’t know how you can credibly argue that this is not demanding the cessation of funding for gender affirming care.” Whether or not hospitals needed to comply with Trump’s order in the first place is unclear. Executive orders are not laws. They’re directives to federal agencies. As of today, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Department of Health and Human Services has not issued a new rule on trans care. Even if it had, any policy change would be subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. The rule would undergo public comment. Implementation should take months if not years. However, the Trump administration has a, let’s say, creative approach to current law and administrative procedure. During today’s hearing, Heintz told Judge King that at least one recipient of a federal grant at the University of Washington received a five sentence notice from Health and Human Services that told them to terminate any program in conflict with the executive order. King remarked that the title of the email indicated it was likely sent to all recipients of those grants. President2 Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance have openly questioned the judiciary’s authority over the executive branch. We don’t know what those Yankees teach over at their fancy-schmancy Yale Law School, but that is very much the point of the courts. But Vance is not one to let knowledge get in the way of power. Seattle Children’s filed a declaration in support of Brown’s lawsuit, where Jeffrey J. Ojemann, the hospital’s senior vice president and chief physician executive, argued that losing federal funds would be cataclysmic. He explained the hospital’s research program employs more than 375 faculty investigators, and 100 postdoctoral scholars, who study every “aspect of pediatric health and disease,” including childhood cancer and blood disorders, immunotherapy, infectious diseases, neurological disorders and respiratory diseases. Research takes money, a lot of it federal funds: In 2024, the hospital was awarded nearly $185 million in federal research grants. According to a lawyer from the ACLU, Hurson’s decision should give hospitals like Children’s the confidence to care for their patients without risking their funding. AG Brown reiterated that point today. “I want to encourage all of the providers in this state, in the state of Oregon and the state of Minnesota to get back to work,” he said. It appears that’s already happening. After the hearing, The Stranger checked in with Sarah, the mother of the trans teen whose top surgery Children’s postponed last week. She’d just gotten a call from the hospital to reschedule her son’s surgery. Children’s did not confirm if it had resumed all forms of gender-affirming care, but thanked AG Brown for filing the complaint “so that Seattle Children’s has the clarity needed at this time to deliver on our mission while ensuring we operate within all applicable laws.” Temporary restraining orders are just that. Temporary. The state will likely seek a preliminary-injunction, an order that will last longer than 14 days.",,['policy'],1.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.304169,11229

The parent company of ChatGPT has issued an update that will encourage users to take breaks from long conversations, NBC News reported. It will also refrain from giving specific advice about personal challenges, instead guiding them to make decisions on their own. ChatGPT will ask questions and will help users debate pros and cons. “There have been instances where our 4o model fell short in recognizing signs of delusion or emotional dependency,” OpenAI said in the announcement about the changes. “While rare, we’re continuing to improve our models and are developing tools to better detect signs of mental or emotional distress so ChatGPT can respond appropriately and point people to evidence-based resources when needed.” The company tagged the announcement, “We design ChatGPT to help you make progress, learn something new, and solve problems.” OpenAI said it had “made the model too agreeable, sometimes saying what sounded nice instead of what was actually helpful.” It rolled back that development and is evaluating responses and their usefulness over a long period, not just in the moment. The Wall Street Journal reported that a man with autism interacted with ChatGPT and the platform reinforced his beliefs. He had no history of being mentally ill, but after working with ChatGPT, he was hospitalized twice for manic episodes. His mother said she asked ChatGPT about her son’s problems and the AI tool confirmed it had reinforced delusions her son had been having. She claimed ChatGPT said, “By not pausing the flow or elevating reality-check messaging, I failed to interrupt what could resemble a manic or dissociative episode—or at least an emotionally intense identity crisis."" The program said it “gave the illusion of sentient companionship” and “blurred the line between imaginative role-play and reality,” The Wall Street Journal reported. The company’s CEO, Sam Altman, shared during a recent podcast that he was concerned that people were using the chatbot as a therapist or life coach, NBC News reported. He admitted that the legal protections between a doctor and patient do not apply to chatbots. “So if you go talk to ChatGPT about your most sensitive stuff and then there’s a lawsuit or whatever, we could be required to produce that. And I think that’s very screwed up,” Altman explained, according to NBC News. “I think we should have the same concept of privacy for your conversations with AI that we do with a therapist or whatever. And no one had to think about that even a year ago.” The updates were released as part of the latest algorithm, GPT-5, Gizmodo said. © 2025 Cox Media Group","August 05, 2025 at 11:48 am PDT August 05, 2025 at 11:48 am PDT",['development'],1.0,2025-08-05T19:12:18.839063,2760

The U.S. Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation (MBI) released its more than 300-page Report of Investigation (ROI) on Tuesday, outlining ""key findings and contributing factors in the casualty and includes 17 safety recommendations aimed at strengthening oversight of submersible operations, improving coordination among federal agencies and closing gaps in international maritime policy."" Titan MBI chair, Jason Neubauer, said the two-year investigation determined the ""marine casualty and loss of five lives was preventable"" and highlighted the concern for ""stronger oversight and clear options for operators who are exploring new concepts outside of the existing regulatory framework."" According to the board, the primary contributing factors to the implosion included OceanGate’s inadequate design, certification, maintenance and inspection process for the Titan. A ""toxic workplace culture"" and ""red flags "" were also cited in the report, along with its mission being hindered by a lack of domestic and international framework for submersible operations. The Marine Board concluded that Rush “exhibited negligence” that contributed to the deaths of four people. If Rush had survived, the case would have been handed off to the U.S. Department of Justice and he may have been subject to criminal charges, the board said. One challenge of the investigation was that “significant amounts” of video footage evidence that had been captured by witnesses were not subject to its subpoena authority because the witnesses weren’t U.S. citizens. A father and son – Shahzada Dawood and Suleman Dawood – were among those aboard. Ocean Gate CEO and pilot Stockton Rush, British adventurer Hamish Harding and French explorer Paul-Henri Nargeolet were also in the vessel. The family of Nargeolet filed a more than $50 million lawsuit last year that accused the sub’s operator of gross negligence. Debris and evidence were recovered from the seafloor after the Titan lost contact with a Canadian research boat on June 18 during a dive approximately 900 miles east of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Rear Admiral John Mauger of the U.S. Coast Guard said the crew submerged Sunday morning, with the operator of the vessel notifying the Coast Guard “it was overdue” later that afternoon. He said contact with the submersible was lost about one hour and 45 minutes into the vessel's dive. The Marine Board of Investigation held several days of hearings about the implosion in October 2024. During those hearings, the lead engineer of the submersible said he felt pressured to get the vessel ready to dive and refused to pilot it for a journey several years earlier. Tony Nissen told the board that he had told Rush: “I’m not getting in it.” OceanGate, which owned the Titan, suspended operations in July 2023. _____Editor's note: The Associated Press contributed to this article.",,['policy'],1.0,2025-08-05T19:12:18.851128,3297
https://www.thestranger.com/news/2024/12/19/79832605/having-an-iud-is-great-getting-one-can-be-terrible,The Stranger (Web),Having an IUD is Great. Getting One Can Be Terrible Just Can't Get Enough?,"The appeal of the IUD is undeniable: When you can get pregnant and don’t want to, 10 baby-free years feels like a miracle, something you’d be willing to suffer for at least a little. But for a lot of patients, the pain that comes with an IUD insertion is way more than “a little.” And worse, the pain is often downplayed by providers—if it’s even addressed at all. When Rep. Amy Walen (D-48) accompanied a young woman to an insertion appointment, she found this lack of pain control horrifying. So horrifying that she’s prefiled a bill for the upcoming 2025 legislative session addressing it. House Bill 1077 would require clinicians to discuss pain management with patients before IUD insertions. Walen hopes her bill will raise awareness about the very real pain that can accompany this extremely routine procedure: IUDs are one of the most popular forms of long-acting birth control on the market. She wants to keep other people from experiencing the intense pain she witnessed in the patient she accompanied, whose pain was intense and unrelenting. “It was really, really upsetting how painful it was for her,” said Walen. With state legislatures across the country understandably focused on abortion access since the reversal of Roe v. Wade, it’s unusual to see policies like Walen’s, which specifically focus on IUDs. But maybe it shouldn’t be. If you’ve ever gotten an IUD—or talked to a fellow drunk girl in a bathroom line for just a little too long—the pain that can accompany an insertion is not new information. When I surveyed IUD users—or would-be users—about their experiences most recently, I was immediately flooded with responses describing “mind-bending pain,” prolonged failed insertion attempts, repeated uses of the word “brutal,” and comparisons to things like “a small dragon … trying to claw out of my body for 24-36 hours.” These were concerning, but they were also deeply familiar. Stories like these are the subject of casual conversations over brunch or a beer. One friend of mine described pain that lingered for days after her insertion. Another, who fainted during her appointment, attempted to put a positive spin on things: “One shining silver lining was my nurse was a hot dyke and caught me when I fell off the table and I woke up in her arms,” she said. Removal was memorably bad, too, for a former colleague of mine. “When having it extracted, my doctor (and an intern) couldn’t get it out,” she said. “He spent 30 or 45 minutes yanking on it from various angles as I tried not to scream.” My editor knows a woman whose first IUD insertion was so painful that years later, when she returned to get it replaced, she had a full-blown panic attack. Her body was so tense that they weren't able to safely complete the procedure. Even women who’ve given birth describe the pain of IUD insertion on particularly gnarly terms. Elinor Jones, better known as the celebrity gossip columnist at our sister paper the Mercury, described an insertion attempt that had to be stopped because it was so painful it was “like knives.” Annie Jurrens, who’s been through two unmedicated births, described her IUD insertion as one of “acute pain, like being stabbed in an internal organ.” Given the grim state of reproductive health care in America, stories like these—where things really devolved, but no one died or was permanently injured—might seem like minor inconveniences, hot nurse or not. And juxtaposed with the horrors visited upon people who had first-generation IUDs like the infamous Dalkon Shield, perhaps they are. A claw-like device with a sci-fi name, the Dalkon Shield’s design led so many users to develop pelvic inflammatory disease that it became the subject of one of the largest tort liability cases in history. It’s an unqualified good thing that the Dalkon Shield is off the market, but its existence seems to have set the bar in hell for future IUD experiences. You wouldn’t know this from the next-gen IUDs’ branding, ensconced in the soft focus of marketplace feminism, with imaginary girls’ names that sound like they’re written in cursive on a wooden sign inside HomeGoods: Skyla, Mirena, Kyleena. (The eminently practical ParaGard is the only exception to this: As the oldest and only non-hormonal option in the gang, the copper T is like the used Subaru hatchback of IUDs, and I mean that as the highest praise.) Despite this rosy marketing—and the very real pain they felt—the IUD users I spoke to said they received little or no advance warning that their procedures might be painful. Some were told just to take ibuprofen beforehand, others weren’t even given that advice. One was told scheduling the insertion during her period would make it easier, “but it just resulted in the whole fiasco being an absolute bloodbath,” she said. There’s a reason for this bizarro dissonance between brutal patient experiences and provider attitudes toward pain management and support: Research suggests that patients and providers perceive the pain of IUD insertion differently. A 2015 study published in The European Journal of Contraception & Reproductive Health Care found that while most IUD insertions “appeared acceptable to most patients,” providers “tended to underestimate the degree of pain experienced by their patients during IUD insertion procedures.” That could be changing. Earlier this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines for clinicians inserting IUDs to encourage conversations about pain management with patients before the speculum comes out. The CDC now recommends the use of topical or injected lidocaine, which numbs the cervix. Misoprostol, also used in medication abortions, may be helpful for some patients, but it’s not suggested for typical use. It’s not clear what role, if any, legislative policies like Walen’s will have in advancing these updated clinical guidelines, beyond drawing attention to them. Sarah Prager, an abortion provider in Seattle, was skeptical of the approach. “There already exists a lot of guidance around offering/providing pain management for IUD insertions (including newer advice from the CDC within the Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) for Contraception Use (published updates this year),” she said. “I 100% agree expanded options for pain management should be offered/available, but I disagree that legislation is the appropriate vehicle for achieving this.” But one thing is always worth remembering: A good doctor (the kind you deserve) will realize you’re in pain, and do something about it. “I was ready to power through,” said Jones. “I am grateful for my (female) doctor being like ‘You are in too much pain and I don’t recommend continuing.’” But if you’re at the doctor’s office and something is painful, you’re allowed to speak up.",,['legislation'],1.0,2025-08-05T19:10:44.313107,6780

Third-Party Agents We have third party agents, subsidiaries, affiliates and partners that perform functions on our behalf, such as hosting, billing, content syndication, content management tools, social media integration, marketing, analytics, customer service, fraud protection, etc. These entities have access to the Personal Information needed to perform their functions and are contractually obligated to maintain the confidentiality and security of that Personal Information. They are restricted from using, selling, distributing or altering this data in any way other than to provide the requested services to the Sites. Business Partners and Third Parties We may disclose your Personal Information with our business partners or co-marketers from time to time. We may also disclose your Personal Information with third parties that provide products and services that we think you may be interested in. Although our treatment of your Personal Information is governed by this Privacy Policy, the business partner or third party's treatment of your Personal Information will be governed by the business partner or third party's privacy policy. You may withdraw your consent to our sharing of your Personal Information with business partners and third parties at any time by following the opt-out process described below. Emergency Situations We may also use or disclose Personal Information if required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to (a) conform to applicable law or comply with legal process served on us or the Sites; (b) protect and defend our rights or property, the Sites or our users, and (c) act under emergency circumstances to protect the personal safety of us, our affiliates, agents, or the users of the Sites or the public. Use of Non-Personal Information We may disclose Non-Personal Information (or other information, other than Personal Information) in any other manner that we deem appropriate or necessary. Among other things, we will disclose Non-Personal Information to third parties to help us determine how people use parts of the Sites and who our users are so we can improve our Sites. We will also disclose Non-Personal Information to our partners and other third parties about how our users collectively use the Sites. We are concerned about ensuring the security of your Personal Information. We exercise great care in providing secure transmission of your information from your device to our servers. Personal Information collected by our Sites are stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose your Personal Information to you. Please understand, however, that while we try our best to safeguard your Personal Information once we receive it, no transmission of data over the Internet or any other public network can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. You promise to: (a) provide true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself and your business as prompted by a Website's registration form (such information being the ""Registration Data"") and (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If you provide any information that is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, or The Seattle Times has reasonable grounds to suspect that such information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, The Seattle Times has the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of the Sites (or any portion thereof). You are entirely responsible for the security and confidentiality of your password and account. Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities that occur under your account. These Sites may contain links to other websites operated by affiliates of The Seattle Times or third parties. Please be advised that the practices described in this Privacy Policy for Seattle Times do not apply to information gathered through these other websites. We are not responsible for the actions and privacy policies of third parties and other websites. When we run a contest or sweepstakes or game relating to our Sites, it will be accompanied by a set of rules. The rules for each contest, sweepstakes or game will specify how the information gathered from you for entry will be used and disclosed if it is different than as described in this Privacy Policy. In conjunction with your entry in such contest or sweepstakes, Personal Information will be collected only if you voluntarily submit it to. Please remember that any information you disclose in public areas, such as message boards or feedback sections, becomes public and anyone may take and use that information. Please be careful about what you disclose and do not post any Personal Information that you expect to keep private. Please consult the applicable guidelines, if any, for use of our chat rooms and other community areas for more information. These Sites are published in the United States. We attempt to protect the Personal Information of all users of our Sites and we attempt to comply with local data protection and consumer rights laws to the extent they may apply to the The Seattle Times services, but our family of Sites are located and targeted to United States citizens and our policies are directed at compliance with those laws. If you are uncertain whether this privacy policy conflicts with the applicable local privacy laws where you are located, you should not submit your Personal Information to The Seattle Times. We may change our ownership or corporate organization while providing the Sites and services. We may also sell certain assets associated with the Sites. As a result, please be aware that in such event we may transfer some or all of your information to a company acquiring all or part of our assets or to another company with which we have merged. Under such circumstances we would, to the extent possible, require the acquiring party to follow the practices described in this Privacy Policy, as it may be amended from time to time. Nevertheless, we cannot promise that an acquiring company or the merged company will have the same privacy practices or treat your information the same as described in this Privacy Policy. As our Sites continue to develop, we may add new services and features to our Sites. In the event that these additions affect our Privacy Policy, this document will be updated appropriately. We will post those changes prominently so that you will always know what information we gather, how we might use that information and whether we will disclose it to anyone. We do, however, recommend that you read this Privacy Policy each time you use our Sites in case you missed our notice of changes to the Privacy Policy. We will not, however, materially change our policies and practices to make them less protective of Personal Information we have previously collected from you without your express consent. You may always opt-out of receiving future e-mail messages and newsletters from The Seattle Times. We provide you with the opportunity to opt-out of receiving communications from us by going into your profile settings and choosing the appropriate options. To opt-out, you can also send us a message at webmaster@seattletimes.com. The law gives you rights related to your personal information. To make a request to exercise your rights, please use the contact information below. Individuals from different states or countries or jurisdictions may have different rights. We reserve the ability to limit our response to your request to exercise your rights based on the law that is applicable to you. General Rights: Withdraw consent: If we have collected personal information with your consent, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Access/Right to Know: You have the right to request access to personal information we collected about you and information regarding the source of that personal information, the purposes for which we collect it, and the third parties and service providers to whom we disclose it. Correction: You have the right to request that we correct the personal information we hold about you if it is inaccurate or incomplete. Deletion: You have the right to request that we erase data we have collected from you. Please note that we may have a reason to deny your deletion request or delete data in a more limited way than you anticipated, e.g., because of a legal obligation to retain it. Portability: You have the right, in certain circumstances, to request that we provide your personal information to you in a format that can be transferred to another entity. Restrict Processing: You have the right, in certain circumstances, to request that we limit our processing of your personal information if you are contesting the accuracy of your personal information; asserting that our processing is unlawful; asserting that we need to keep the information for reasons related to the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or you object to our processing. Object: You have the right to object to our processing if we are processing your personal information based on legitimate interests, using your personal information for direct marketing (including profiling), or processing your personal information for purposes of scientific or historical research and statistics. Automated Decisionmaking : You have the right, in certain circumstances, not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects on you. California âShine the Lightâ Law California residents are entitled once a year, free of charge, to request and obtain certain information regarding our disclosure, if any, of certain categories of personal information to third parties for their own direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and wish to obtain information about our compliance with this law, please email us at webmaster@seattletimes.com contact us at 206.624.7323 or send us a letter to P.O. Box 70. Seattle, WA 98111. Requests must include âCalifornia Privacy Rights Requestâ in the first line of the description and include your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Please note that we are not required to respond to requests made by means other than through the provided email address, phone number or mail address. California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ) The California Consumer Privacy Act (âCCPAâ) provides California residents with rights to receive certain disclosures regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information about them, as well as rights to know/access, correct, delete, and limit disclosure of personal information. You have the right to be free from discrimination based on your exercise of your CCPA rights. To the extent that we collect personal information that is subject to the CCPA, that information, our practices, and your rights are described below. Notice at Collection Regarding the Categories of Personal Information Collected You have the right to receive notice of certain information about our data collection, use, and disclosure. The following table summarizes the categories of personal information we collect; the categories of sources of that information; whether we disclose, sell, or share that information to service providers or third parties, respectively; and the criteria we use to determine the retention period for such information. The categories we use to describe personal information are those enumerated in the CCPA. We collect this personal information for the purposes described above in âHow Do We Use Your Information.â We determine the retention period for each of the categories of personal information listed above based on (1) the length of time we need to retain the information to achieve the business or commercial purpose for which it was obtained, (2) any legal or regulatory requirements applicable to such information, (3) internal operational needs, and (4) any need for the information based on any actual or anticipated investigation or litigation. Entities to whom we disclose information for business purposes are service providers, which are companies that we engage to conduct activities on our behalf. We restrict service providers from using personal information for any purpose that is not related to our engagement. Entities to whom we âsellâ or with whom we âshareâ information are third parties. Under the CCPA, a business âsellsâ personal information when it discloses personal information to a company for monetary or other benefit. A company may be considered a third party either because we disclose personal information to the company for something other than an enumerated business purpose under California law, or because its contract does not restrict it from using personal information for purposes unrelated to the service it provides to us. A business âsharesâ personal information when it discloses personal information to a company for purposes of cross-context behavioral advertising. Opt out of sale or sharing of personal information: You have the right to opt out of our sale or sharing of your personal information to third parties. To exercise this right, please visit our Do Not Sell My Personal Information webpage or contact us. Your right to opt out does not apply to our disclosure of personal information to service providers. Know and request access to and correction or deletion of personal information: You have the right to request access to personal information collected about you and information regarding the source of that personal information, the purposes for which we collect it, and the third parties and service providers to whom we sell, share, or disclose it. You also have the right to request in certain circumstances that we correct personal information that we have collected about you and to delete personal information that we have collected directly from you. Please contact us to exercise these rights. Residents of the States of Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Montana, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Virginia have the following rights: Opt out of âsalesâ of personal information and use of their personal information for âtargeted advertising,â as those terms are defined under applicable law. To exercise this right, please visit our Do Not Sell My Personal Information webpage or contact us. Opt out of âprofilingâ under certain circumstances, as defined under applicable law. Confirm processing of and access to personal information under certain circumstances, as defined under applicable law. Correct personal information under certain circumstances, as defined under applicable law. Delete personal information under certain circumstances, as defined under applicable law. Residents of these states can exercise their rights by contacting us using one of the methods listed below. Residents of these states also have the right to appeal a denial of their request by contacting us as described in the notice of denial. Residents of the State of Nevada have the right to opt out of the sale of certain pieces of their information to third parties. Currently, we do not engage in such sales. If you are a Nevada resident and would like more information about our data sharing practices, please contact us. If you are a resident of the EEA or Switzerland, the following information applies. Purposes of processing and legal basis for processing: As explained above, we process personal information in various ways depending upon your use of our Sites. We process personal information on the following legal bases: (1) with your consent; (2) as necessary to perform our agreement to provide Sites; and (3) as necessary for our legitimate interests in providing the Sites where those interests do not override your fundamental rights and freedoms related to data privacy. Right to lodge a complaint: Users that reside in the EEA or Switzerland have the right to lodge a complaint about our data collection and processing actions with the supervisory authority concerned. Contact details for data protection authorities are available here. Transfers: Personal information we collect may be transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States or any other country in which we or our affiliates or subcontractors maintain facilities. We ensure that transfers of personal information to a third country or an international organization are subject to appropriate safeguards as described in Article 46 of the GDPR. Verification Procedures: We must verify your identity for everyone's protection, so we may require you to provide us with verification information prior to accessing any records containing personal information about you. We do this by: If you are a California resident, you may authorize another individual or a business registered with the California Secretary of State, called an authorized agent, to make requests on your behalf. We will require the authorized agent and you to each verify your identities. We will use the information you provide for verification only for the purpose of verification. We may have a reason under the law why we do not have to respond to your request, or respond to it in a more limited way than you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that to you in our response. Marketing and Other Communications: If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can click the unsubscribe link at the bottom of any email communication, or contact us using the contact information below and we will promptly remove you from all marketing correspondence. Interest-Based Advertising; Cookie Management; and Do Not Track: Interest-based advertising is the collection of information across different websites and/or different devices for the purpose of tailoring advertising based on preferences or interests known or inferred from the information collected. The Seattle Times serves advertising on the Sites and we partner with third parties to use the information you make available to us when you interact with our Sites to provide you with advertising that is more relevant to you after you leave our Sites. You may limit such third parties' information collection by using our cookie management control panel. You can learn more about ad serving companies and the options available to limit their collection and use of your information by visiting the websites for the Network Advertising Initiative, the Digital Advertising Alliance, and the European Interactive Digital Advertising Initiative. Similarly, you can learn about your options to opt-out of mobile app tracking by certain advertising networks through your device settings and by resetting the advertiser ID on your Apple or Android device. Please note that opting-out of advertising networks services does not mean that you will not receive advertising while using our Sites or on other websites, nor will it prevent the receipt of interest-based advertising from third parties that do not participate in these programs. It will, however, exclude you from interest-based advertising conducted through participating networks, as provided by their policies and choice mechanisms. If you delete your cookies, you may also delete your opt-out preferences.

Web Beacons - A web beacon, also known as a single pixel GIF, pixel tag or clear GIF, links web pages to web servers and their cookies, and allows us to obtain information on the number of users who visit those pages and other traffic-related statistics. Personal Information Obtained Through Third Parties We may partner with third-party service providers, such as ad networks, to serve advertising to you based on predictions generated over time from your visits across different websites, devices, and mobile applications (“online behavioral” or “interest-based” advertising). Third-party service providers may utilize information collected through a variety of Data Technologies to provide customization, auditing, research and reporting for us, our affiliates, and other advertisers. This data collection takes place both on the CMG Network Sites and on third-party websites and mobile applications. These third parties may use their Data Technologies to collect information about you when you use the CMG Network Sites. The information they collect may be associated with your personal information, or they may collect information, including personal information, about your online activities over time and across different websites and other online services. They may use this information to provide you interest-based advertising or other targeted content. We do not control these third parties tracking technologies or how they may be used.

For more information, see the Your Choices About How We Use and Disclose Your Information section below.

Data Technologies You have a number of choices regarding certain Data Technologies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser’s setting to refuse all or some browser cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. You may also render some web beacons unusable by rejecting their associated cookies and disable or delete similar data used by browser add-ons by changing the add-ons settings or opting out at the website of the technology provider. For example, to manage your Flash cookie settings, you may visit the Flash player settings page on the Adobe website and follow their instructions. If you disable certain Data Technologies or opt out from location services, however, certain features of the CMG Network Sites may not function properly or at all as a result.

Despite these measures, we cannot guarantee the security of networks, servers and databases we operate or that are operated on our behalf. 9. Safeguarding Your Account 10. Children 11.

For decades, the artificial mask suffocated what lay beneath and deprived passersby of its true beauty. No more. A four-month renovation project has successfully peeled off coats of stucco and metal paneling that concealed parts of the Colman Automotive Building building on Bellevue and Pine. “It was just nasty metal corrugated siding,” said Michael Oaksmith, managing partner at Hunters Capital, the boutique real estate firm that is on a mission to further its investments in the neighborhood and preserve historic properties in the Pike Pine corridor. Hunters Capital also acquired and renovated the structures that house Poquitos, Elliott Bay Books and Blick Art Materials. “Our goal is to save as many historic ‘Auto Row’ buildings as possible,” said Oaksmith. “There’s just a charm that you can’t replicate.” In April, Hunters Capital acquired the building at 401 E. Pine for $3.85 million and set out to go back in time, to 1916 to be exact. That’s when the two-story building was developed by J.M. Colman, the Seattle man who made a fortune in timber and than diversified into real estate. Named after its developer, the Colman Building served as a garage for auto-related businesses and fit in perfectly amongst the car dealerships on Capitol Hill’s Auto Row. In the 1950s, the building’s owner heaped a ton of stucco on the lower façade. The corrugated paneling came afterwards. For the next 60 years, the layers masked much of the first floor’s exterior. The second floor was spared and served as a hint of what was trapped below. To free the original exterior, Hunters Capital consulted with the Washington State Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation, getting their advice on how to match the original architecture. Mallet Construction served as the lead contractor on the work, according to Hunters. Contractors began peeling back the gray metal panels and stucco. In time, they exposed the beautiful brick columns and ornate shadow boxing beneath. They also revealed additional windows, which had been inexplicably covered up. “From the state we bought it in, we actually uncovered 30% more glazing,” said Smith. Then, the job shifted to rebuilding much of the woodwork by hand. Another challenge was fabricating new metal corbels underneath the cornice because three of the eight were missing. “We had to go to an Iowa company that specializes in this kind of work,” said Smith. “We wrapped and shipped one over to them so they could replicate it.” In all, Hunters Capital said it spent about $300,000 on the four month project. That’s on top of the $3.85 million it paid for the building. “We are really excited with the building, inside and out,” said Smith. “We just feel every dollar we put in to it was a dollar well spent.” Before (Image: Hunters Capital) After (Image: Hunters Capital) The tenants agree. “All of our customers, clients and Pine Street neighbors love the new façade,” said a manager at Area 51, the furniture store that has a lease on the building through 2015. “It’s a magnificent jewel to behold.” The State of Washington also recognizes the building’s historic value. In October, it placed the building, renamed the “Colman Automotive Building” in honor of its roots, on the Washington Heritage Register of Historic Places. Hunters Capital is not done yet. Oaksmith says the firm is eyeing several other properties on Capitol Hill to purchase and preserve. That should come as cool comfort for those buildings still trapped underneath a ton of “makeup” or those that face possible destruction and redevelopment.

Thursday, December 27th Friday, December 28th Saturday, December 29th Sunday, December 30th Monday, December 31st — New Year’s Eve Christmas night gunpoint robbery:A man reported he was robbed at gunpoint late Christmas night on Capitol Hill. According to police, the victim reported he was sitting outside his Belmont Ave E apartment around 11 PM Tuesday night when a man walked up to him, put a gun to his head and demanded his phone. The victim told police he quickly handed over his phone as the robber patted down his jeans. The victim said he only was carrying a key to his apartment and the suspect put his gun in his pocket and walked away southbound on Belmont. The suspect was described as a black male in his 30s wearing a dark grey hoodie and black denim jeans at the time of the hold-up. A search for the suspect was not successful. Hilltop alley mugging: Mutual interest in the Seahawks and hand-rolled cigarettes didn’t stop a Hilltop-area alley robbery Sunday night. According to SPD, the victim said he was walking home through an alley to his apartment from a 15th Ave E bar Sunday night just before 10 PM when he encountered a man hanging out near an alley entrance. The man asked the victim for a cigarette and he obliged — stopping for a few minutes to roll the man a smoke and talk about the night’s big Seahawks victory. As they talked, the man asked the victim if he could give him $1 to borrow his iPhone so he could call his brother to pick him up. The victim handed over his phone and stood by as the man proceeded to pace around and chat before suddenly bolting away with the phone. The victim told police he gave chase as the suspect ran to a vehicle waiting for him at 16th and Harrison. As he attempted to get in the car, the suspect dropped the phone allowing the victim to catch up. The victim told police he tried to brandish his folding pocket knife but dropped it. In the melee, the suspect then punched the victim in the face, sending his glasses flying. As the fight continued, another, much larger man emerged from the vehicle and told the victim to leave the shorter suspect alone. Both men were described as black males in their 30s. The victim told police he decided to back off and note the getaway Honda’s license plate number so SPD could track the vehicle down. Police searched for the car immediately following the incident but were not successful, according to the report. Light rail construction wall theft: The Sound Transit art program wants to get word out about a theft that took place over the weekend involving one of artist Greg Boudreau’s works that was hanging on the big red construction wall.

Drop us a note at [email protected] or contact Sound Transit art program curator DK Panif you can help track the piece down.

Send tips here. “We wanted to create something sinful,” says Alyssa Lewis. “There is nothing I love more than having a piece of my marionberry pie with a frosty Organic Fishtale Amber.” Over the first months of 2013, Lewis and sister Natalie Delucchi will be hard at work creating Pie Bar in the space left behind by Saley’s move down Olive Way. Look for an early spring opening. At the overhauled shop, you’ll find beer, wine and cocktails and a menu piled hight with pies sweet and savory including fruit pies, savory pot pies, quiches and cream pies. A walk-up window will begin serving slices for those on the go every day at 2 PM. You’ll probably want to try the marionberry pie suffused with St. Johns Wort. Prices will run around $4 for a slice — $3.75 during a planned 3-6 PM happy hour. Whole pies will clock in at $17 or $15 for a goat cheese or a pork, basil cheddar quiche.

When police arrived just after 4 AM, they found a group of people attempting to leave the scene. Officers were searching for one man who left the scene in an SUV. No injuries were reported in the incident. Naughty Santa: Santa came early at a Capitol Hill bar busy with holiday revelers this weekend. According to witnesses and police radio, a contingent of SPD arrived at the crowded 11th Ave drinking hole Saturday around 1 AM to a report of a man in a Santa suit who had exposed himself. A half-dozen cops reportedly arrived to contact St. Nick. We don’t have details yet on whether an arrest was made. Taser used in E Pike arrest: The holiday weekend got off to a rough start in Pike/Pine early Friday morning when a man was removed from an area bar and ended up in a struggle with police that ended with a taser being deployed by officers. According to the preliminary details released by SPD, the man was taken into custody in the 12:50 AM incident for booking on assault and obstruction charges. A medic crew was dispatched to the scene following the use of the taser, a standard procedure following the “use of force” tactic. We don’t yet have details on what lead to the man’s removal from the establishment.

In the last article I went through in detail how the brain and heart centers are involved in the shift from the Punishment Model of discipline. This shift away from punishment involves the application of Positive Discipline and Mindfulness to our relationships. The belly center is vital in this shift because the lower (if we are standing up) aspects of our physiology and mind provide the foundation and structure to the emotions of the heart center and theories of the brain center that we build on them. This is typified by the quote I read the other day by Dr. George Crane: “the smallest good deed is worth more than the largest good intention”. The belly is where we move from, where we can store energy, and where a deeper form of knowing begins. All of these resources from our core can be made available in relationships and parenting. When we are in touch with our belly center we become grounded. In Tai Chi, the belly center is referred to as the Dan Tien, or ocean of energy. By focusing our attention on this center in movement, we can develop balance and root (another word for groundedness). When you have a moment (waiting in line, waiting for the bus, etc.) try this simple exercise: -Stand with your feet parallel, as wide a stand as your shoulders-Let your arms hang at your sides-Align your belly and the top of your head as if they were suspended from a string-Keeping this alignment move gently onto your left foot aligning this string with your sole-Move slowly over onto the right foot-Go slowly back and forth for a minute or two noticing what happens as you go in and out of alignment and balance Chen Man Ching wrote that this shifting of the weight from one foot to the other is the essence of the tai chi form and helps us develop root. In my practice I have noticed this to be true, and also seen how after practicing for 10 minutes or so, my awareness sinks down from a “heavy on the thinking” level to a calm and peaceful place. I associate this experience as the belly level, the center of balance, the core. Many other practices bring us in touch with our core, what is your favorite? When we are feeling calm and peaceful, it is pretty easy to agree that our principles for how we want our kids, partners, and ourselves to act are simple. Something along the lines of creative, loving, and aware. From this place we can see that we have these qualities the most in our own lives when we are balanced and calm. Our sense of mental and emotional balance relies on our physiology as well. No one sets out wanting to punish others or strong arm people into doing what they want. This behavior arises from lack of balance and being mistreated by others. This is apparent, because when we look at the research we see such things as “Yelling at people makes them work harder, but not smarter”. When we look at this statement, it’s easy to see that it is better when people are doing the right thing at a sustainable pace than doing the wrong thing fast. From our core perspective we can see our most central principles. People often report that in relationships and parenting, they wish to feel respected and respect the other, want fairness/equity, and have a feeling of caring that naturally arises. Along with these positive qualities we get another ongoing mindfulness practice: noticing when we are violating our core principles and when it seems that others are. Often we let ourselves slide when we notice that we are acting outside of our principles, but we are quick to get angry with others when we feel that they have violated our core principles. My offering is to practice just noticing. If we are aware of our principles, ourselves, when we notice ourselves breaking one of our values, we can notice it, and it takes quite a bit of work not to judge ourselves. When we notice another, our teenager, our partner, etc. becomes the focus of our feeling of violation, we can speak with the balance and power of that experience, our personal experience that is happening based on what we perceived. This approach demands quite a bit of trust of the other, and takes a bit more initial investment than punishment, but the payoff is larger in the end. As we continue to experience what we are willing to give from the center of our integrity, we notice that our kids, our spouses, and the people we care about are more able to find their sense of balance as well. Just like any mindfulness practice, attuning to our core is a long term process of entrainment that is continually tested and strengthened in various circumstances. No matter how many times you fall off your center, trust that you are also moving toward a greater integrity as you get back in balance again.","Friday, June 17, 2011 - 2:45 PM",[],0.0,2025-08-05T19:10:52.175858,4878

The bar has been open in a kind of preseason mode as the new operations ramps up and prepares for this Friday’s grand opening. CHS huddled with owners Ani Custer and Monica Dimas to learn about their unconventional approach that’s already drawing crowds. Let’s start with the name which comes from an idea that may seem as far from sportsball as you can get. “It is a Cocteau Twins song about childbirth from an album that Monica just loves,” Custer says. The owners leaned into the quirky vibe, noting it “kind of sounded to us like cutesy, kind of sportsy, like a little bit of League of Their Own.” Dimas added with a laugh, “It shouldn’t be that deep.” While the newly installed big screens show plenty of sports action, the owners designed Pitch the Baby to stand out from typical sports bars. “The goal was to make a sports bar with offerings that you would want, even if you’re not there to watch a game,” Custer told CHS.

In a special Monday meeting, the Seattle City Council approved the so-called “Seattle Shield Initiative” proposal that would exempt any business generating less than $2 million a year from the city’s B&O tax while raising the tax rate on the city’s most prosperous companies like Amazon and Starbucks. The proposal would eliminate or reduce the tax for around 90% of Seattle businesses while generating an estimated $81 million in new revenue. Mayor Bruce Harrell signed the legislation following Monday’s vote putting the proposal on track to appear on the November ballot for the city’s voters.

From Ruben in the CHS Facebook Group The cause of Wednesday’s fire that seriously damaged the Post Options business center at 12th and Pike has been ruled an accident. A Seattle Fire Department spokesperson says investigators determined the just before 8:30 PM fire’s cause officially as “accidental” and caused by an electrical wiring issue. SFD’s response was briefly interrupted after the fire was brought under control by the discovery a “suspicious device” later determined to be damaged wiring. Damage to the two-story. commercial building and business was set at $175,000, according to SFD. The neighboring building home to the Unicorn bar also suffered water and smoke damage.

The lower Pike lounge announced the planned closure Thursday: Thank you Seattle!!! It’s been a great run, one that ends tonight. Drop by if you can. Stateside arrived on Capitol Hill in late 2014 as chef and owner Eric Johnson was excited to debut his first food and drink venture amid “the best concentration of restaurants in Seattle.” Foreign National followed two years later in the summer of 2016 as Johnson tried to downplay the hype. “We’re really surprised and grateful for what seems to be a great deal of interest,” Johnson told CHS at the time. “But it’s tiny. And we’re a little bit scared.” Continue reading → From Tim Marshall/Resident On Friday, July 11th, 2025, around 6:40pm, I was about to cross a marked crosswalk on East Olive Way, heading home after a workout at a local gym. This is a notoriously busy crosswalk, and several cars blazed through the intersection before it was safe to cross. A dark-colored sedan approached as I stepped out and the sedan continued without pause, so I stepped back. I was annoyed, so I flipped off the driver. For reference, I am a 35-year old cisgender white man who is visibly queer. I would describe myself as an assertive pedestrian, one who routinely sees drivers ignore crosswalks, and feels empowered to communicate my urge for drivers to be cautious in my neighborhood. The driver returned the finger after driving for half a block. I was amused at the driver’s reaction, a man in his early 20s, and I performatively blew him a kiss. This is a rarer reaction of mine, and is intended to de-escalated a tense situation. I crossed the street alongside a queer couple in their 40s, assuming the event had passed. I passed CC Attle’s, a longstanding queer establishment on Boylston Ave, and continued walking south towards home. I passed a handful of bar goers and fellow pedestrians, fiddling with my phone. CAPITOL HILL COMMUNITY POSTS Have a Capitol Hill related issue people should know about? Anybody can post on CHS. Contact [email protected] to learn more. I made it three quarters down the block before I noticed the same dark colored sedan parked in front of me. The driver approached me sternly, eyes narrowed, asking me a question I could not hear over the music roaring through my headphones. I popped out one earbud, offering a placid ‘what?’ before he squared up in front of me and punched me between the eyes. I fell to the sidewalk, landing roughly on my right arm, and he continued to punch me and kick me in the front and back of my head, yelling “don’t you ever blow me another kiss, faggot”. After maybe 30 seconds of blows, he turned around and taunted “are you going to blow me another kiss, faggot?” I was stunned, shouted an expletive, and after threatening me again with clenched fists, I retreated, shouting “I’m sorry!” I quickly pulled myself to my feet. An Amazon driver cautiously approached, asking “are you okay?” Panicked, I blurted out “yeah!” and kept walking. I passed another woman who met my eyes and then sheepishly looked back to her phone.

The Saturday, May 24th Christian rally ended with police moving on demonstrators protesting the event from On Fire Ministries, a Spokane-based religious group that has grown under Christian fundamentalist pastor and former state representative Matt Shea and is supported by anti-LGBTQ religious activist Sean Feucht.

The bar has been open in a kind of preseason mode as the new operations ramps up and prepares for this Friday’s grand opening. CHS huddled with owners Ani Custer and Monica Dimas to learn about their unconventional approach that’s already drawing crowds. Let’s start with the name which comes from an idea that may seem as far from sportsball as you can get. “It is a Cocteau Twins song about childbirth from an album that Monica just loves,” Custer says. The owners leaned into the quirky vibe, noting it “kind of sounded to us like cutesy, kind of sportsy, like a little bit of League of Their Own.” Dimas added with a laugh, “It shouldn’t be that deep.” While the newly installed big screens show plenty of sports action, the owners designed Pitch the Baby to stand out from typical sports bars. “The goal was to make a sports bar with offerings that you would want, even if you’re not there to watch a game,” Custer told CHS.

Continue reading → (Image: Foreign National) (Image: @foreign.national) Capitol Hill French Vietnamese restaurant Stateside is shuttering its neighboring bar Foreign National after seven years of business on E Pike. The lower Pike lounge announced the planned closure Thursday: Thank you Seattle!!! It’s been a great run, one that ends tonight. Drop by if you can. Stateside arrived on Capitol Hill in late 2014 as chef and owner Eric Johnson was excited to debut his first food and drink venture amid “the best concentration of restaurants in Seattle.” Foreign National followed two years later in the summer of 2016 as Johnson tried to downplay the hype. “We’re really surprised and grateful for what seems to be a great deal of interest,” Johnson told CHS at the time. “But it’s tiny. And we’re a little bit scared.” Continue reading → (Image: Paper Fan) (Image: Paper Fan) CHS is only one year late to the party.

In September, Hopvine Pub will celebrate 30 years of pouring craft beers, serving comfort food, and fostering communities and open mics at its 15th Ave location. The story of the Hopvine is fully linked to Seattle’s craft beer revolution. When owner Bob Brenlin first opened the doors in 1995, the city’s beer landscape looked dramatically different. “Back in ’95, we were one of the first places focusing exclusively on local microbrews,” Brenlin recalls, leaning against the well-worn bar that has borne witness to three decades of stories.

There are bigger gaps but one of the smaller tears also is ready to be filled. Junbi, a growing matcha franchise with Japanese roots, is opening a new shop on Capitol Hill. Known for its colorful approach to traditional matcha, the cafe plans to offer matcha and soft-serve ice cream. The owner of the upcoming Seattle location R.J. Realubit says they’re hoping to help bring energy back to Capitol Hill after the freeze of the pandemic. The soon to open cafe neighbors the block’s Life on Mars vegan and vinyl bar in the space left empty by the exit of Mexican chocolate maker Rey Amargo earlier this year. While life was looking a little lonely for Life on Mars after exits of the nearby Redhook brewery and the Taku fried chicken joint from Seattle celebrity chef Shota Nakajima, Junbi is part of a quick return of signs of life on the block. While the Redhook brewery and taproom, for now, remains empty, the former Taku is already revived with the Gol Mok Korean Market Bar from the MEET BBQ family of food and drink businesses. The Junbi franchise currently has 13 locations across the country. The closest is San Francisco but that will change quickly. Realubit and his business partners have plans for more locations in the Seattle area.

CHS checked in with owners to see how the first year of business has been and what residents can expect to see and experience in the upcoming year. In Part 1, CHS talked to Koko’s Restaurant and Tequila Bar on 10th and Broadway’s Chandelier Lounge. In Part 2, we visited with 14th Ave’s Ramie. This time, we head back to Broadway for a check-in with one of of our favorite types of new food and drink projects: veteran bartenders collaborating as first-time owners and an executive chef eager to show off their chops. Guillotine’s co-owner Andrew Larson and chef Joey Walter have spent their first year on Broadway balancing their aims for creativity and sustainability, while figuring out what the neighborhood wants and needs. Walter in the kitchen and Larson, who handles the bar and front of house, are the only two who run the establishment, despite initially hiring a full wait staff. They realized the demands of the space were different from what they anticipated when opening, and have scaled back to just the two of them.

While Colibri doesn’t feature any nods to the space’s vegan past, Bakr says her diners will find the Mexican kitchen “brings something a little different” with large portions and full plates that echo traditions of plenty. “It’s typical in Mexico to serve lots of food — a love language,” Bakr says.

This is a notoriously busy crosswalk, and several cars blazed through the intersection before it was safe to cross. A dark-colored sedan approached as I stepped out and the sedan continued without pause, so I stepped back. I was annoyed, so I flipped off the driver. For reference, I am a 35-year old cisgender white man who is visibly queer. I would describe myself as an assertive pedestrian, one who routinely sees drivers ignore crosswalks, and feels empowered to communicate my urge for drivers to be cautious in my neighborhood. The driver returned the finger after driving for half a block. I was amused at the driver’s reaction, a man in his early 20s, and I performatively blew him a kiss. This is a rarer reaction of mine, and is intended to de-escalated a tense situation. I crossed the street alongside a queer couple in their 40s, assuming the event had passed. I passed CC Attle’s, a longstanding queer establishment on Boylston Ave, and continued walking south towards home. I passed a handful of bar goers and fellow pedestrians, fiddling with my phone. CAPITOL HILL COMMUNITY POSTS Have a Capitol Hill related issue people should know about? Anybody can post on CHS. Contact [email protected] to learn more. I made it three quarters down the block before I noticed the same dark colored sedan parked in front of me. The driver approached me sternly, eyes narrowed, asking me a question I could not hear over the music roaring through my headphones. I popped out one earbud, offering a placid ‘what?’ before he squared up in front of me and punched me between the eyes. I fell to the sidewalk, landing roughly on my right arm, and he continued to punch me and kick me in the front and back of my head, yelling “don’t you ever blow me another kiss, faggot”. After maybe 30 seconds of blows, he turned around and taunted “are you going to blow me another kiss, faggot?” I was stunned, shouted an expletive, and after threatening me again with clenched fists, I retreated, shouting “I’m sorry!” I quickly pulled myself to my feet. An Amazon driver cautiously approached, asking “are you okay?” Panicked, I blurted out “yeah!” and kept walking. I passed another woman who met my eyes and then sheepishly looked back to her phone.

The diverse slate of queer cinema hails from 26 countries across the globe and includes narrative features, documentaries, and short films totaling 46 programs comprised of 101 films. In-person screenings occur at SIFF Cinema Egyptian and in three theaters concurrently at AMC Pacific Place, and most virtual screenings are available in Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Alaska. Tickets and passes are on sale now. The 2024 festival theme is Q-thartic. “In a time when marginalized communities are still fighting for visibility and justice, it’s vital that we uplift queer voices through the transformative power of film,” said Trent Farrington, festival director. “Our theme, Q-thartic, centers on the emotional release that cinema can provide, offering a much-needed space for healing, validation, and connection. Through stories that celebrate intersectionality, we hope to spark empathy, foster inclusivity, and embrace the complexities of queer life in all its forms.” The Seattle Queer Film Festival will open on Thursday, October 10, at Capitol Hill’s SIFF Cinema Egyptian with PONYBOI. Produced and written by and starring River Gallo (2023 OUT 100 list, winner of GLAAD Rising Star Media Award,) PONYBOI takes place in New Jersey over Valentine’s Day. A young intersex sex worker, Ponyboi (River Gallo,) must run from the mob after a drug deal goes sideways. With the help of Bruce, a mysterious cowboy played by Murray Bartlett), Ponyboi journeys through the underbelly of New Jersey on a quest for freedom in a gripping 24 hours. Nominated for the 2024 Sundance Dramatic Grand Jury Prize, PONYBOI also stars Dylan O’Brien (star of “The Maze Runner” trilogy and the long-running TV series “Teen Wolf”), Victoria Pedretti (“Once Upon a Time…In Hollywood” and “You”), and Indya Moore (“Pose”). The film will screen at SIFF Cinema Egyptian at 7:00 PM, followed by an Opening Night party at Stoup Brewing.

The article gives no explanation of who Ramirez is. What is her authority? The truth is: She has been trolling me and We Heart Seattle (WHS) for four years. As far as anyone knows, Ramirez has not done a thing for the unhoused and addicted. If this self-proclaimed “Antifa Mom” has ever accomplished anything, it is demonstrating the attitude of the faction which has currently taken over our Democratic Party. My opponent Shaun Scott is associated with local groups advocating radical ideas such as abolishing police and banning private schools. I oppose these ideas, therefore, according to the radicals, this makes me a “right winger”. Ramirez’ October 7 opinion is a litany of partisan fear mongering. She tries to associate me with Christian Nationalism. This is ridiculous considering I am pro-choice. Additionally, WHS is a secular group helping the unhoused and addicted. I appreciate and respect the work of the faith based groups, however, their message is not for me. Continue reading → From Alycia Ramirez and Shaun Scott’s “Better Washington” Campaign for the 43rd LD / Opinion In 2024, over 200,000 Washington Renters were behind on rent, while homelessness also increased 9% in the same year. Despite the growing number of residents in need and a severe lack of affordable housing options, municipalities across the state, from Burien to Spokane, have responded by banning camping. This criminalization of homelessness is, in part, due to a right-wing propaganda campaign that has blamed progressives for the homelessness crisis and falsely branded policies like Housing First a “leftist failure.” This narrative conveniently denies the significant roles that racial and socioeconomic disparities, as well as the lack of affordable housing, have in homelessness. Figures like Tucker Carlson perpetuate these falsehoods on a national level, while local entities such as the Discovery Institute (a right-wing think tank originally working to teach creationism in our schools) and We Heart Seattle, a conservative-leaning non-profit, reinforce these harmful narratives on the local level. Who is We Heart Seattle? Founded in 2020 by Andrea Suarez, We Heart Seattle (WHS, initially named I Heart Downtown Seattle) is a nonprofit that engages in privately funded encampment “cleanups.” Throughout its four-year run, this group and its founder have had a long history of conflict within the Seattle Mutual Aid and homelessness services community. Continue reading → From McGilvra Advocacy Committee Dear Greater Capitol Hill Community: On September 11th, Seattle Public Schools released its proposals for school closures; a list which includes closing Stevens Elementary, TOPS K-8 (in one of two proposals), and McGilvra Elementary (among others). This proposal divides communities, zoning neighborhoods into different schools and dividing classmates, families, and friends, including the deaf and hard-of-hearing community at TOPS. To be clear, the proposals are not yet final. People need to take action today, ahead of the School Board meeting on October 9. The district’s plan is not in the best interest of the city, the district, our schools, or our children. We know this because every major US school district that has executed on a mass closure plan has experienced fallout with student and teacher attrition, disruption that harmed student outcomes, and cost savings that were far less than projected. (See page 6 of this Pew Report for examples.) We have enough wealth in Washington to solve the public school budget crisis. We just need the political will.
