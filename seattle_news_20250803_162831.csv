Now we’ll see if Rachael Savage is also an environmentalist. Washington’s Department of Ecology may be wandering into a neighborhood hornet’s nest as it begins the public process on the Stewart House Cleanup Site under its affordable housing grant program. The DESC and the department are entering into an agreement on a state funded cleanup of the site where decades of waste from oil furnaces has accumulated. The Belmont Ave properties home to a trio of former transitional housing buildings from Pioneer Human Services were acquired in a $6.5 million deal last year as the DESC made plans for a new 120-unit apartment building with onsite services for its residents on the block. A 30-day public comment period on the cleanup agreement ends at midnight on May 6th. “Many communities in Washington are facing a housing crunch, but one Ecology program is helping to ease the shortage,” the state’s announcement of public comment window reads. “Our Affordable Housing Cleanup Grant Program provides grants to developers to help clean up contaminated sites. In return, the developers redevelop the property, with at least 40% of the square footage slated for affordable housing for at least 30 years.” The documents from the agreement are posted here. “The properties have historically been the site of apartment buildings heated by oil furnaces. Soil at the cleanup site has been contaminated by petroleum products that leaked out of underground storage tanks,” the state says. “The extent of the contamination will be studied during the future remedial investigation phase.” The state grant process around the projects has been streamlined by the legislature. In 2022, the permanent program was established to provide the grants for planning and cleanup of contaminated sites intended for affordable development. But the process adds another wrinkle to the DESC’s plans in the neighborhood. CHS broke the news on the project this fall as the organization confirmed its planning for “a new Permanent Supportive Housing project” on the parcels it purchased over the summer. King County’s program to fund the projects says permanent supportive housing is housing “for a household that is homeless on entry, where the individual or a household member has a condition of disability, such as mental illness, substance abuse, chronic health issues, or other conditions that create multiple and serious ongoing barriers to housing stability.” City permitting is already approved to demolish the vacant buildings to make way for the new 120-unit DESC permanent supportive housing project. An August fire mostly destroyed one of the buildings waiting to be torn down. Belmont DESC will serve people earning 30% and 50% of Area Median Income who are experiencing chronic homelessness. DESC says its tenants usually earn about 9% to 12% of AMI. The Belmont building will feature only studio units and is being designed for single adult residents. Opposition to the project includes residents and building owners who say the area is already overburdened by the challenges around halfway houses and housing programs for at-risk populations. Broadway business owner and Republican candidate for mayor Rachael Savage made opposition to the plan an early foundation of her “Savage Citizens” campaign. “Capitol Hill already has over three hundred people housed in multiple buildings that operate on this model variously called Housing First, Permanent Supportive Housing or Low Barrier Housing,” Savage said “Our streets are in chaos. We have done enough.” Environmental appeals have become a regular aspect of the long delays faced by development projects around Seattle and, especially, in the city’s largest, most important decisions. CHS reported here as appeals including cases representing Madison Valley, Mount Baker, Hawthorne Hills, and “73 remaining Southern resident killer whales” have gummed up Seattle’s efforts to meet state zoning requirements and arrive at a new 20-year growth plan for the city. The Department of Ecology program, meanwhile, has already been at work in Seattle where a grant-boosted cleanup cleared the way for The Maddux, an affordable project from the Mt. Baker Housing organization just off Rainier. In 2018, the state awarded Mt. Baker Housing $400,000 to start assessing the cleanup project. The legislature later awarded another $6.2 million to finish the project. The cleanup began in June 2020 and took five months to complete. The corner had previously been home to a dry cleaner and gas station. An initial state report on the Stewart House site was completed in 2018. “The presence and/or condition of groundwater has not yet been assessed at the site,” the state’s updated reporting reads. The Department of Ecology is holding a hybrid in-person and virtual “open house” on the project on April 15th. Documents are available online here or in-person from the Capitol Hill library branch.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/06/27/80120394/progressive-revenue-is-not-dead-in-seattle,The Stranger,Progressive Revenue Is Not Dead in Seattle Just Can't Get Enough?,"Seattle electeds have finally realized that they can’t simply rely on the Jumpstart Tax, a progressive (but fluctuating) payroll tax, to backfill budget shortfalls in perpetuity, and they are pursuing new progressive revenue options. I know, I know, this city council and this mayor finding new revenue methods? Our financial outlook is that bad. The Seattle Shield Initiative united an odd duo, Council Member Alexis Mercedes Rinck and Mayor Bruce Harrell. Together, they proposed the initiative to help alleviate the financial stress that a $251 million deficit across all fund balances—and Trump in the White House—will put on the city. The initiative will temporarily raise business and occupation (B&O) taxes to fund programs threatened by the Donald Trump administration, such as investments in housing vouchers, shelters, food and nutrition access, resources for survivors of gender-based violence, and affordable housing. But it gets better. The initiative doesn’t raise the B&O tax for all businesses, only some. Under the initiative, to help bolster struggling mom and pop shops, many small businesses will actually stop paying B&O tax. Sounds pretty good, right? Not if you’re part of a big business organization. The Downtown Seattle Association (DSA, but not the cool one) and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce have already poo-poo’d the proposed initiative. Jon Scholes, president and CEO of the DSA (derogatory) and frequent bad-opinion columnist at the Seattle Times, said in a statement that the Trump tariffs are already bad for business and city leaders are about to “make things worse on local companies” with this new tax. “This proposal is a tax on downtown Seattle’s revitalization and a self-inflicted wound to the progress we’ve been making to attract more businesses downtown and strengthen the city’s tax base. It will make it harder to fill empty tall office buildings and storefronts with companies, which will threaten the commercial tax base and shift more of the tax burden to residents,” Scholes wrote. The Seattle Shield Initiative will raise the B&O tax threshold exemption from $100,000 to $2,000,000 in gross revenue, which means 76 percent of small businesses won’t pay any B&O tax at all. Meanwhile, only businesses earning more than $2 million in revenue will have to pay a higher tax than they did before. According to a press release from the city, “approximately 90% of businesses would owe less than they do today.” Of course, that means those high-earners would shoulder the B&O tax. This is unfair, according to Scholes. “City leaders should heed the lessons from the past and reject boneheaded ideas solely concocted in the name of fighting President Trump,” Scholes wrote. “This rushed tax proposal is bad fiscal policy that will set Seattle back and raise costs for residents.” He had some big, weird feelings (“It’s the fiscal policy version of Seattle’s defund the police movement and if passed will ultimately result in Seattle defunding its tax base,” he wrote on LinkedIn. “This idea should be thrown in the trash bin next to the remnants of defund the police, CHOP/CHAZ, legalizing drugs, etc”) and I’m sure we’ll hear more from him in a forthcoming Seattle Times editorial. But, I must say, this is pretty funny outrage coming from the organization that just pushed policy through the Seattle City Council to put eyesore digital advertising kiosks on Seattle streets. The money earned from those kiosks will go right back into DSA coffers. Maybe they can use some of that money to help their struggling big businesses pay the B&O tax increase. In response to these comments, at a press conference, Harrell said, “We think it’s good policy, and we would disagree [with the DSA].” Remember, this is from longtime DSA (again, not the socialist one) ally Harrell. Do we… gotta hand it to him? “We are not trying to run business out of Seattle, we are open for business,” Harrell, newly anointed fan of progressive revenue (or just a man worried about being another one-term mayor), continued. “So as we look at dealing with a $250 million deficit… The fact is that the state legislature only gives us so many tools, and this is a tool we think along the lines of progressive revenue that is a smart policy to adopt...We will do everything possible to continue to have a healthy business environment, but we stand behind this policy.” In a statement to The Stranger, Mercedes Rinck said, ""It’s true. This proposal progressively shifts B&O tax burden to the largest businesses in Seattle. The top 10 percent will pay more, and the bottom and middle will pay less. I think we can all see that as a worthwhile investment in the local community, workforce, and economy. What will actually set Seattle back is doing nothing while thousands in our community are on the brink of food insecurity and homelessness due to draconian federal cuts."" Wealthy business owner gripes aside, this initiative is a boon for small businesses, according to Jeanie Chunn, community activist, longtime small business advocate, and current candidate for City Council District 2. Chunn, who helped engage small business owners on this initiative for Rinck's office, described how paying fewer B&O taxes will make a huge difference. Especially for businesses operating on the margins like restaurants, having extra funds could pay for much-needed new equipment, new benefits for employees, or repairs. The initiative will provide “much welcomed relief,” she wrote in an email. According to Chunn, most restaurants fall under the $2 million revenue threshold. Even for those who rake in over $2 million annually, they’ll still pay less in local B&O taxes than they do currently because “it's only on sales over $2M.” The Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce jumped to its usual excuses for the reasons we can’t raise taxes: It has some “interesting ideas,” but it’s “rushed,” and companies just can’t afford it right now. “I think the Chamber of Commerce's outrage over this initiative shows that they have and will always represent the interests of large corporations and not locally-owned businesses, small business owners, or the workers of Seattle,” Chunn wrote. ""If the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce only wants to advocate for the preferences of their Emerald and Platinum members, that is their prerogative,"" Mercedes Rinck told The Stranger. ""Local government has responsibility to step up in this moment, and our proposal gives Seattle residents that choice."" However, the Seattle Shield Initiative is not law yet. Rinck will need to curry favor with the other members of the council. They will have to vote on the initiative by Aug. 5. If it's approved, we the people will get to have our say in the November election.

https://www.thestranger.com/stranger-election-control-board/2025/07/03/80128730/vote-for-dionne-foster-for-city-council-position-9,The Stranger,Vote for Dionne Foster for City Council Position 9 Just Can't Get Enough?,"Seattle will not have a functional city government until Sara Nelson is KO’d so far out of our political orbit that she’ll be nothing more than a footnote: a forgettable, one-time City Council President who reigned over this legislative body during a remarkably chaotic and useless time in its history. At this point, progressives would endorse a cinder block over Nelson if it had a pulse and a fixed Seattle address. Fortunately, we don’t have to. Because we have Dionne Foster, an excellent candidate for this office. Rejoice! Foster, a former policy advisor for the city and the former executive director of the nonprofit Washington Progress Alliance, is a knowledgeable, likable, competent wonk. She wants to lead the way on economic justice. Stop this city’s affordability crisis and addiction to sweeps from displacing people. She’ll fight conservatives on this council willing to divert JumpStart funds from affordable housing. Unlike Nelson, Foster knows Seattle must go harder for housing density than the legal minimum set by the state and that it’s unrealistic for a real city expecting major growth in the next two decades to click its ruby red heels, ignore its housing needs, and remain an overgrown, dysfunctional suburb forever. Foster also wants to embrace affordability and outrun Washington’s regressive tax code with progressive revenue. She wants a municipal capital gains tax, a vacancy tax, and working with the state on a mansion tax. She has the right plans and can articulate exactly how she’d implement them, a rare quality on our curb-busting city council. She’s granular, but not myopic. And we believe her because she already did this work at the state level to pass the limited capital gains tax Foster has earned a heap of endorsements from politicians like Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, State Rep. Shaun Scott (D-43), and Scott’s dearly departed predecessor, Frank Chopp, because she is the best, quickest-witted candidate to walk through our door this election cycle. With two other seats up for reelection, that’s a chance she won’t be a progressive island on council. Nelson, on the other hand, is a fundamentally un-democratic chaos agent and a disastrous leader whose sole purpose has been to accumulate political power. Her Council’s “accomplishments” have been wildly unpopular: Approving a police contract with big raises and no accountability? Putting blast balls back in the hands of untrustworthy cops, and ensuring they can surveil us? Establishing “stay out” zones for drug users and sex workers that stigmatize people and don’t work? Attempting to weaken our ethics code and repeal protections for gig workers? We’re embarrassed. Seattle is immobilized in Nelson’s… full Nelson, controlled by business interests who shelled out hundreds of thousands of dollars for her meandering status quo that squeezes the renters, the poor, the homeless, and the disadvantaged on the margins. A skilled politician at least pretends to listen. Nelson is either incapable or indifferent. She shuts down anyone who is too loud and cumbersome for her taste. Her hostility for representative government and working people is boundless. But in her hallowed chambers at least we’ll have decorum, won’t we? Her contempt for the public seemed like the only reason competitor Connor Nash, a former state and federal employee, joined this race. Mia Jacobsen, on the other hand, is running a protest campaign to overhaul the system that puts people like Nelson in the driver’s seat. Nash was angry, shooed away too many times. But Nelson isn’t just the rock and the hard place. She’s a liability. A threat to reforms from a more progressive council, a roadblock to desperately needed progress on housing and homelessness, and the last person we want in city government when President Donald Trump comes to play. We’re tired of incompetence. We want someone with ideas, who loves this city and its people. A vote for Nelson is a vote for nihilism. A vote for Foster is a vote for intelligence, compassion, solutions, and a chance for a future. Vote Foster.",,"['city council', 'election', 'candidate', 'municipal', 'housing', 'homeless', 'homelessness', 'police', 'policy', 'city council (title)']",22.5,2025-08-03T16:25:54.237258,4079

It was a close one. The department reported 84 successful hires in 2024 — one more officer than it lost. Monday, Mayor Bruce Harrell and city officials held a press conference with a bolder mood as officials say SPD’s hiring momentum has continued with 60 officers hired here through April: The 60 officers hired so far in 2025 are more than in the last three years at this point combined. This includes experienced officers who can get started working sooner, with as many lateral hires in 2025 as in the previous five years at this point combined, and as many re-hires as in the last three years combined. Separations are also below the last five years through mid-April. If current trends continue, SPD is on track to hire over 150 officers in 2025, which would be the largest total hires in any year in recent record. Harrell and new SPD Chief Shon Barnes said Monday that the hiring comes on the back of a continued influx of candidates with the department receiving 1,218 officer applications by the end of the first quarter this year, compared to 690 applications at that point in 2024. Harrell, in the early stages of his reelection campaign to keep his office at City Hall, placed the quarter year’s hiring turnaround in context of his administration’s efforts to reform the department and grow efforts like the city’s new Community Assisted Response & Engagement CARE crisis responders while also pushing back on cutbacks or downsizing of SPD despite growing budget gaps and revenue uncertainty for the city. “A well-staffed and well-trained police department is essential to effective public safety in Seattle,” Harrell said. “Our work to modernize recruiting and increase qualified applications is showing results through record hiring in 2025 – putting us on a path to restore Seattle Police Department staffing,” The mayor and City Council president Sara Nelson, also facing reelection, have pushed for a goal of growing SPD’s ranks from the just under 1,000 officers on patrol in 2022 to nearly 1,500 by 2027. CHS reported here on the hiring of former Madison, Wisconsin chief Barnes to lead SPD and his focus on recruitment and retention at the department though large initiatives and smaller issues like infrastructure investments to improve the work environment including smaller upgrades like new carpet and fresh paint. The signs of a turnaround come as Seattle Police officials late last year said the department’s ranks had fallen to the lowest numbers in 30 years as the Seattle City Council expanded a program that pays out a $7,500 hiring bonus to new recruits and boosts bonuses for so-called “lateral” hiring from other police departments to $50,000 as the Harrell administration said Seattle continues to face regional competition for officers. SPD also launched a new recruiting advertising campaign this summer featuring “cartoon versions of police officers in various heroic scenarios.” The campaign is part of a $2.5 million budget in 2025 for police recruitment advertising and marketing. The department has also vowed to improve its recruitment of women even as the city faces ongoing harassment litigation from the department under ousted Chief Adrian Diaz. Publicola reported this week on SPD’s struggles despite its commitment to the “30 by 30” pledge calling for a 30% female recruit class by 2030. Publicola reports that only five of the 60 new hires touted by Harrell Monday are women. Paying cops more is helping. Seattle ranked 29th in the region to start 2024 for base pay for its new recruits an issue the bonus program won’t address. The city and the Seattle Police Officers Guild arrived at a new contract last spring that boosted pay 23%. The city says new recruits now start at a $103,000 a year salary with a $7,500 hiring incentive, and qualified lateral transfers from another agency start at $116,000 with a $50,000 incentive. SPD also says its “average hiring process for police officer candidates” has been streamlined from 5-9 months to 3-5 months. “On average, it takes about a year after graduating from the academy for recruits to become a Seattle Police Officer working an assigned patrol beat,” the city’s report on the hiring success said. Police officer candidates must be at least 20.5 years of age, have a high school diploma or GED equivalent, be generally physically fit, and be able to obtain a Washington driver’s license. There is no upper age limit to apply. In 2023, a 62-year-old joined the force. Monday, officials pointed at citywide crime totals that they say show encouraging public safety trends. CHS reported this month on those totals for the East Precinct that showed Capitol Hill and the Central District have been left out of the rest of city’s dip in reported property crime. East Precinct Violent Crime Report Totals East Precinct Property Crime Report Totals To start 2025 as he begins his campaign for a second term leading the city, Harrell has held up the turnaround in hiring as a key accomplishment of his administration. So far, Harrell’s most significant political challenge has emerged from his political left where progressive activist Katie Wilson is building her campaign around her work leading the Transit Riders Union and minimum wage and renter rights campaigns around the region.

The appointment process sucked; the unimaginative snoozers on the city council selected multiple-SECB-endorsement-loser Mark Solomon to take the seat. Luckily, Solomon isn’t running to keep the seat, so we have an open race on our hands! Which brings us to the pool of four viable D2 hopefuls: Union guy and SDCI inspector Jamie Fackler; restaurant organizer and activist Jeanie Chunn; assistant city attorney Eddie Lin; and mayoral transportation engagement manager Adonis Ducksworth. After a lively (read: tense, yell-y) discussion, the clear choice for D2 is Eddie Lin. As an assistant city attorney, Lin’s focus for the last several years has been working with the Office of Housing. When it comes to housing, and building more of it, Lin knows his stuff. In the midst of a never-ending housing crisis and a new Social Housing Developer on its way through the Seattle Process’s long birth canal, we need someone who can get shit done. Lin knows we need subsidized affordable units, social housing, limited equity co-ops, and everything else under the sun to get people four walls and a roof. Plus, whoever sits on council will implement Mayor Bruce Harrell’s Comprehensive Plan. Lin, a fiend for density and walkable neighborhoods, is a smart choice to kickstart the next 20 years of Seattle’s growth. One of the main hits against Lin, as Fackler repeatedly brought up, was that he didn’t go all out championing Proposition 1A, the voter measure that set up a funding mechanism for the Social Housing Developer. Lin didn't vote for it because, as a housing wonk, he was concerned that it was vulnerable to being undermined by a more conservative, Chamber-backed City Council. However, he says he’s come around and is ready to champion it. He’s also a total slut (sorry, Eddie) for progressive revenue. He’s DFAIT (Down For An Income Tax), a vacancy tax, and a city-level capital gains tax. We liked Chunn’s idea for a commercial vacancy tax, but felt she was still a little too green to hack it in City Hall. We hope to see her again. The other knock against Lin is, like all other candidates except Chunn, he wants more cops. Lin’s desire for increased police presence does go hand-in-hand with hiring a more diverse police force and expanding police alternatives. Plus, Lin’s experience with police brutality made him wary of cops. In his 20s, a Minneapolis police officer cuffed him, put his hands on his throat, and made racist comments—confusing Lin, who is Asian, for a Native American. The rattling experience forever changed Lin’s view of policing. We felt Fackler, while progressive and knowledgeable about the same issues, was too soft on the cops, especially their union. We’re certain Ducksworth will win the Seattle Times endorsement. He’s suave, charming, and doesn’t answer a single question. He’s also fucking cool. Sadly, underneath his skater chic, Ducksworth is nothing but a visionless moderate (read: Bruce Harrell). We already doubted he’d be our guy from the start, and he did us a solid by confirming that with a shitty, uninformed comment blaming drug users for their own predicament. “I did the ride along last week, and these guys asked at least 50 people, are they ready to go to treatment? We got one. We got one. So this comes down to the person on the street, too. Who wants to get off the street,” Ducksworth said. “That’s because some of the treatment options are not—,” Lin said. “They’re not asking about the treatment options,” Ducksworth interrupted. “They’re getting high.” Ducksworth’s mask came off. We did not like it under there. So, Lin is our guy. He’s the whole package. He’s a cat guy and a dog guy. He’s a public schools champion. This is why we willfully turned a blind eye to the fact that he could only name two examples when asked what his four favorite films were and one of them was White Lotus Season 1, famously not a movie. If he’s even seen a movie, he wasn’t paying attention. There weren’t enough housing solutions for his taste. Vote Lin. Editors Note: This endorsement originally appeared in The Stranger's July 2025 issue. In that version, we said Lin voted to support Prop 1A. After publication, his campaign clarified that he voted for 1B in February, but supports the social housing model now. We regret the error. Also, Jamie Fackler's last name is ""Fackler"" not ""Frackler"" (as it appeared in one instance in print). We regret the ""r.""

The press release from the mayor’s office touts the hundred-hire milestone but doesn’t include statistics on the department’s current ranks.

Pigeon behinds butted over the lip of the building’s roof, pooping with abandon. A person named Bug stood on the small walkway jutting into the park’s reflecting pool and scraped at one of the arched windows, attempting to free Seattle’s new favorite art piece, a guerilla mosaic known as Saint Rat or Hot Rat Summer, from the prison of paint slapped on by the maintenance team at Seattle Public Utilities (SPU). Another person, Cyanasen (the unofficial custodian of the saintly rat), kept watch while smoking a joint. “I come here daily. I hang out with the rat wall and I clean up a lot of stuff and help maintain it,” Cyanesen says. (She says the mosaic is different from Saint Rat, a familiar graffiti tag around town. She calls it Hot Rat Summer.) No one can say exactly when, but sometime last summer a mystery artist cemented the mosaic of a rat standing in profile on multi-hued green grass, a flaming heart near its paw and a halo behind its head, onto the SPU building. Beneath its feet, under the grass, on a background of fire, are the words “Hot Rat Summer.” Seattle University art history professor Ken Allan writes that the piece “refers to Byzantine mosaic tradition in a fun way” and “the use of architecture nicely echoes this.” (Allan told The Stranger that he wants to examine Hot Rat Summer in person and will send more thoughts.) The public loves Hot Rat Summer. It’s a celebration of weird Seattle, of life in the city. Tripadvisor now lists it as a thing to do. The trans community particularly loves the piece. Rats are downtrodden, rejected by society, and harmed for being what they are. That resonates, Cyanesen says. Yet, since the mosaic's (immaculate) conception, the city has waged holy war against it. According to Cyanesen, the rat steward, the city has painted over the piece “eight or nine times,” which Hot Rat Summer enjoyers have scraped off again and again. This battle has seemingly come to an end. After the most recent rat erasure, a public commenter dressed as Saint Rat/Hot Rat Summer showed up to City Hall. City Council Members Joy Hollingsworth and Alexis Mercedes Rinck announced they would personally remove the paint covering the art. At around 2:00 p.m. Wednesday, Rinck and Hollingsworth arrived with a Lowe’s bucket filled with supplies and a ladder to do a job already well underway. Bug had been scraping for an hour and a half, and would stay hours after others left (at 5:30 p.m., Bug was still scraping). And before Bug got there, a “different guy” had put paint stripper on the wall. “This is a beautiful expression about what this neighborhood is all about and this neighborhood has been through it recently,” Rinck says. “These are dark times. Let the people have rats.” Rarely does anything this gold stay in a city hellbent on eradicating unsanctioned public art. Seattle City Council recently passed a law that both raises fines against frequent graffiti taggers to $1,500 and allows the City Attorney to bring civil penalties against them. Rinck was the only one on the council to vote against it. According to Rinck, whether or not this mosaic is different from the graffiti the current mayoral administration and city council majority hates is, like art, subjective. But the only one who can make that determination is Mayor Bruce Harrell, she says. However, it seems like City Attorney Ann Davison and the city council get their say as well. Davison proposed this new graffiti crackdown initiative, but only asked for $1,000 fines. The council’s Public Safety Committee, which includes Bob Kettle, Rob Saka, Joy Hollingsworth, Council President Sara Nelson, and Vacant (the ghost of Cathy Moore), were not satisfied with that sum. It was too low. In the committee meeting, Saka said he proposed his amendment to raise the fine to $1,500 “to make [taggers] hurt financially.” It passed out of committee. Saka and Kettle voted for it, while Hollingsworth and Nelson abstained. Hollingsworth, who voted to pass the bill with the increased fine, says the legislation won’t apply to Hot Rat Summer because it’s public art and “very different from tagging.” “This isn’t someone’s name,” Hollingsworth says. “This is a mosaic.” She then explained what a mosaic was, which The Stranger knew, The Stranger was there. “It reminds me of a stained glass window.” There’s no distinction between mosaics and graffiti in the Seattle Municipal Code, where graffiti is defined as any “unauthorized markings visible from premises open to the public, that have been placed upon any property through the use of paint, ink, chalk, dye or any other substance capable of marking property.” In spite of that, Hollingsworth says she’s been supportive of “stuff like this” since she was elected. Rats? No, no, public art. Last year, she allocated $225,000 in the budget to fund a mural walk (not quite the same thing as a guerilla rat mosaic, but go off). But she says she plans on introducing new legislation that would designate certain city-owned spaces for people to make art. She also wants to repaint the Cal Anderson bathroom in the colors of the trans flag, which was painted to protest the Christian Supremacist rally at the park in May, and zhuzh up the Black Lives Matter memorial on Pine Street. Hollingsworth says Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) “came and covered [Hot Rat Summer] up” multiple times without the council’s knowledge. The Cal Anderson gatehouse is its responsibility, not the responsibility of Seattle Parks and Recreation, which took heat for this. Ultimately, Hollingsworth blames bureaucracy for Hot Ratgate, both why SPU covered the mosaic and why nobody listened when she tried to raise the issue last year. She says she didn’t come out with a paint scraper and ladder because people are mad. She cares. Whatever her motivation, Hollingsworth says Hot Rat Summer is here to stay. “The Parks Department gave me their word, and so did the Mayor’s office, that they’re gonna send a crew out to restore this in the next couple days and professionally seal it,” Hollingsworth says. SPU won’t be fucking around with it anymore either. “Make sure you print this,” she says. “[SPU] have told me that they will do every window on here,” gesturing to the blank gatehouse windows “with some type of work from the community. And the city will pay for it because we’ll pay those artists.” There’s still one important question Hollingsworth wants to know. Who made Hot Rat Summer? Cyanesen just wants them to do a crow mosaic next.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/07/17/80153045/thousands-of-bruce-harrells-employees-endorse-his-opponent,The Stranger,Thousands of Bruce Harrell’s Employees Endorse His Opponent Just Can't Get Enough?,"This morning, in front of a small crowd of union members at City Hall, mayoral candidate Katie Wilson stood at a podium to accept an endorsement from PROTEC17. “I am so honored to receive the endorsement of PROTEC17, and so grateful to the thousands of city employees who have decided to put their faith in our campaign because they believe in our vision of what Seattle can be,” she said. A post shared by The Stranger 🗞 (@thestrangerseattle) The Working Families Party, the small but mighty progressive political party, spoke about why they were endorsing her. So did reps from UAW 4121 (graduate school workers), WFSE 1495 (state employees), the American Federation of Teachers (obvious, I hope), all of whom have already endorsed her. But PROTEC17 was the headliner. This isn’t Wilson’s first endorsement, or even her first labor endorsement. So why throw a press conference about it? Because PROTEC17 represents more than 3,000 city workers in Seattle—almost a quarter of the city’s workforce—which means this union is endorsing against their boss. This is the first time in recent memory that they’ve endorsed in the primary. At the press conference, Karen Estevenin, Executive Director of PROTEC17, expressed two concerns that define Wilson’s campaign: affordability and progressive revenue. Katie shares their union values, Estevenin said. “Katie overwhelmingly won our support with her concrete ideas, her doable plans to address these and many other issues that city workers and Seattle residents are facing,” she said. “PROTEC17 members, along with so many in this moment, are hungry for elected officials who can offer hope, who can offer inspiration, authenticity and a clear vision for a better world and the dogged tenacity to create it.” In a blue city whose politics is defined by labor and business, Wilson seems like a natural union choice. In the last decade and a half, she’s been one of the lead organizers in the campaigns to raise the minimum wage (in Seattle and Burien), make transit affordable (you can thank her for that unlimited low-income Orca Card), and protect renters (she helped cap late fees and move in fees). But this Spring, MLK Labor Council (our county’s Union of Unions, so to speak), endorsed Mayor Bruce Harrell. So did SEIU 775, the caregivers union and main funder of Seattle’s Progressive People Power PAC. The vote wasn’t unanimous, and several major unions reportedly abstained, but the endorsement got through. Katie Garrow, executive secretary-treasurer of MLK Labor, told the Seattle Times that they endorsed Harrell because he has a “proven track record of delivering real results for working people.” At the time, the “results” she pointed to were the city’s housing and transportation tax levies, and a new contract for the city’s unions that was more labor-friendly than expected. “Now, more than ever, blue cities like Seattle need experienced, strong elected leaders to uphold our values,” Garrow told the Seattle Times. That was back in May, though, when Harrell’s fundraising seemed like it was leaving Wilson in the dust and most of the city didn’t know her name. It was easier to consider Harrell’s reelection as a foregone conclusion. In July, they’re neck and neck. Both candidates have collected the maximum number of democracy vouchers they’re allowed to in the primary, and they’ve raised almost the same amount of money: Harrell has raised $449,980 and Wilson has raised $449,829. Wilson even has slightly more individual contributors—5,978 to Harrell’s 5,100. Outside of the feelings in the greater labor community, though, it’s no surprise that Harrell’s own employees might want a new boss. KUOW reported in March that, according to his niece (and senior deputy mayor) and six other women in City Hall, his administration is a misogynistic boys club, where women were condescended to and shut out of meetings in favor of white male advisors. Last year, PubliCola reported that the mayor’s office borrowed staff (and therefore budget lines) from other departments. The year prior, Harrell’s offered a 1 percent cost of living for essential city workers like electricians and librarians, while trying to coax rookie cops to join SPD with six-figure salaries and $30,000 signing bonuses, inspired workers to protest on the steps of City Hall. Today, Wilson stood with city workers in the same place. “I have been organizing alongside workers and labor unions for the whole of my career, because I believe deeply in the principle that lies at the very heart of the labor movement, solidarity.”",,"['mayor', 'mayoral', 'candidate', 'budget', 'housing', 'transportation', 'SPD']",17.0,2025-08-03T16:25:54.236257,4564

Challenger Katie Wilson seems to have a top-two result all but wrapped up. “This woman is so smart, she’s kicked my ass so many times in so many debates,” repeat mayoral candidate Joe Mallahan said Tuesday night during a candidates forum focused on District 3 issues organized by the Leschi Community Council, the Central Area Neighborhood District Council, and the Coalition of Immigrants Refugees and Communities of Color. Mallahan’s admission — he’s currently running third in fundraising in the race with $122,000 in campaign contributions plus another $15,000 from an independent expenditure committee — made it pretty clear he knows Wilson is going through to November’s General Election. Wilson and incumbent Bruce Harrell’s campaigns have both reported raising around $450,000 each. Harrell is also backed by a $200,000 “Bruce Harrell 4 SeattlesFuture” independent expenditure committee. “We have great values here in Seattle but we often fail to live up to them,” Wilson said Tuesday night in her pitch to the crowd inside Leschi’s Grace United Methodist Church as she positioned her leadership as a collaborative and active effort to push beyond current City Hall leadership’s moderate leanings. Wilson promised an administration that would be more aggressive in galvanizing the city against federal cutbacks and attacks on DEI programs. She said she would back efforts to civilianize more of the work currently saddling the Seattle Police Department, expand alternative responses like the CARE crisis responders, and fix the city’s “broken” police accountability system. And she said she would lead in unity with the city’s community organizations and labor unions — “I’m a believer in the power of organization,” Wilson said. The progressive organizer who is the executive directors of the Transit Riders Union and helped lead minimum wage and renter rights campaigns around the region won the endorsement of the 43rd District Democrats last month. Tuesday night, Harrell “had another appointment and couldn’t move his schedule,” forum organizers told the crowd. In 2021’s primary, voters in Leschi and this area of the city were strong supporters of the Central District born and raised candidate. Harrell’s absence might have been to his advantage. The mayor did not have to respond to the role former T-Mobile executive Mallahan has settled into of Harrell basher with hopes of somehow henpecking the incumbent into third place and out of the race. “I believe the city of Seattle is badly mismanaged,” the repeat mayoral candidate said during one of his times at the microphone, calling Harrell a “disrespectful, vindictive, finger-pointer of a mayor.” You can watch the full candidates forum here.

Today is our last day in the 80s for a while. We’ll slide into the weekend with some perfect Seattle weather in the high 70s, and it’ll last through the first half of next week. Let’s do the news. Who Wants to Build Trump’s Fighter Jets Anyway? More than 3,200 machinists in Boeing’s St. Louis-based defense division are threatening to walk off the job on Sunday and halt production of their military planes. Boeing, who totally isn’t worried about their stock prices, reminded Seattle Times readers that this was just a tenth of the size of last year’s strike in the PNW that tanked their productivity. They also want you to know that this won’t affect production of Trump’s vanity project, the F-47, which is their newest defense contract. Out-of-State PAC Money Rolls into City Council Race: Stranger Staff Writer Nathalie Graham reported yesterday that the National Association of Realtors, a Chicago-based political action committee, already spent nearly $70,000 on mailers for Council President Sara Nelson’s bid to stay on the Seattle City Council. That adds to the more than $400,000 war chest Nelson already has for her campaign to hang onto her council seat. To counter that out-of-state spending, her best competition, Dionne Foster, got some support from Seattle’s progressive PAC, helpfully named Progressive People Power (or P3). As a rule, they don’t get involved until the general, but the Nelson/Foster race got them in the mix early. Toe-to-Toe: New polling from the Northwest Progressive Institute (NPI) showed Foster four points ahead of Nelson with likely voters, once they were provided the information in the voter pamphlet. Those four points are within the margin of error, so statistically, it’s a tie. But with Nelson’s record-low approval ratings, I’d bet she’s feeling nervous. Meanwhile, in the other city-wide council seat, NPI polling found that Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck looks likely to win reelection pretty comfortably, despite the Seattle Times’ refusal to endorse in that race because, as they said, while the candidates were “an interesting group of hopefuls” (a sitting council person) and “very nice,” none of them met their criteria for an endorsement (good). It seems like Republican candidate Rachael Savage sees the writing on the wall, so she’s taking her whole campaign message and turning it into a citizen initiative to ban homeless camping in Seattle and force people to choose between treatment and arrest. The Shield Tax Is Working Its Way Through Council: Yesterday, City Council heard public comment and voted on 17 amendments for the progressive tax code overhaul called the Shield Initiative. Introduced by Councilmember Rinck and Mayor Bruce Harrell, it would eliminate or lower the B&O tax for small businesses, raise the tax for Seattle’s 2,300 highest-grossing companies, and raise $90 million in the process. Public commenters overwhelmingly spoke in support of the bill (the only exceptions being the extremely pro-business Downtown Seattle Association and the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce). A huge number of people working on food access showed up, because under a Trump administration, this initiative could literally be the difference between people eating and not. Council should vote on the full initiative on Monday, just shy of the deadline to get it on the November ballot, and let the people decide. Nuclear Fusion in Everett? The Everett-based company, Helion, announced that it broke ground on the world’s first nuclear fusion power plant. The only problem? It’s not clear if they’ve actually figured out how to turn fusion into power. Maybe that’s a problem for Future Helion. Fernando’s Going Home, for Now: Fernando Alves Rocha, the theater manager at Juanita High School in Kirkland, is expected to be released on a $10,000 bond. He’s been in the Northwest ICE Processing Center for nearly two weeks after immigration officers arrested him in his driveway. They claim he overstayed his tourist visa in 2018. His attorney told KUOW that Rocha filed an asylum application a day before his visa expired in 2018, and that he’s had a valid work permit since his asylum application has been pending. Our Hometown Counterterrorist: Remember when Joe Kent, Trump’s “Young Gun,” was running for Congress in Southern Washington? Well, the former Green Beret and friend to White Supremacists was just confirmed by the Senate as the country’s top counter terrorism official. Trump’s Tariff Tantrums: The deadline for tariffs to come crashing down on every one of our trade partners is tomorrow, so there’s a lot of tariff news: Trump has escalated the fight with Brazil, raising their tariffs to 50 percent and slapping sanctions on the judge that’s investigating Bolsonaro (because dictators look after their own, sometimes); the Administration settled on a 15 percent tariff rate with South Korea; and countries are agreeing to buy more US fuel than they need just to get Trump off their back. And then there’s Canada. Trump said this morning that it would be “very hard” to make a trade deal with our neighbors to the north if they dared to follow in the UK and France’s footsteps and recognize Palestine’s statehood. As a reminder, 147 out of 193 UN member states recognize Palestinian statehood. We’re the problem. Gazans Are Starving and Capitalism Still Rules: Most Gazans depend on aid drops for sustenance at this point, but there are still some operating markets, selling limited produce, pantry staples, and some looted aid package materials. There, a kilo of sugar is more than $100. Baby formula is $51. Let me say that again. Baby formula for starving infants is $51. This Is Fascism: Another Ivy League university has paid off the Trump administration in exchange for being allowed to exist. Brown University agreed to make $50 million in payments to state workforce development programs over the next 10 years, and said they would comply with the Trump administration’s overall ideology, including bans on transgender athletes participating in collegiate sports. Because our federal government is the mob now? Uh Oh, I Agree with the NYT Editorial Board: The New York Times editorial board took a shot at the Supreme Court this week, calling them out for their lack of transparency around their rulings about the Trump administration: Federal judges are not elected by the public. Nor are they supposed to make decisions based on their ideological preferences. Our political system instead vests them with the power to decide whether the president, Congress and other lawmakers are enacting policies that are consistent with previous laws, court rulings and, above all, the Constitution. For these reasons, the credibility of judges depends on their ability to offer public explanation for the legal basis of their decisions…Clear explanation is especially important for the Supreme Court, which sets national rules that lower courts must follow. When the court fails to make these rules clear, confusion can set in. The current Supreme Court is creating precisely this problem by issuing many important rulings as brief, unsigned orders on its so-called emergency docket. On this docket (also known as the shadow docket), the votes among the nine justices are not public, and the majorities typically offer little explanation for their decisions. Yet the justices have used the emergency docket this year to hand down a series of rulings allowing President Trump to expand executive power and alter the structure of government. Preach.

Will They Show Up Today? Just Can't Get Enough?,"However devout your atheism, for the sake of Seattle renters and what’s left of Mark Solomon’s hairline, pray that his city council colleagues actually do on Tuesday what they couldn’t manage at last week’s Housing and Human Services Committee (HHS) meeting: Show the hell up. Last Wednesday, after an 18-month delay, members of the Seattle Renters Commission were scheduled to finally be appointed—and in some cases reappointed—to the city’s volunteer renters advisory board. Commissioners, supporters, and rental advocates filled council chambers anticipating an appointment vote, only for the process to collapse. Neither Council President Sara Nelson nor Councilmember Rob Saka attended, leaving the committee short of quorum. With former chair Cathy Moore having already resigned, the committee could afford to lose no more than two members. “Look, people are volunteering their time. They’re not getting paid for this. We owe it to them to listen and make it happen,” Solomon, the committee’s vice chair, told The Stranger. On paper, the Seattle Renters’ Commission exists to give renters a seat at the table of influence that too often forgets they’re there. It’s charged with advising the Mayor, City Council, and city departments on the policies that shape whether tenants merely scrape by, or live with a shred of stability in a city where north of $128,000 still has many hitting the Grocery Outlet every other week. Nelson had informed Solomon the day before she’d be absent, without offering a public explanation. Saka, citing personal reasons, notified Solomon less than 30 minutes before the 9:30 a.m. start time that he couldn’t attend. Solomon told The Stranger that he believed that the two had legitimate reasons for not showing up, but other council members weren’t as generous. “It’s hard for me to read this as anything other than intentional suppression of representation of renters who are at much higher risk of being displaced. The people in this city deserve people who will actually show up for them and do the work,” Alexis Mercedes Rinck, a member of Solomon’s committee and the only renter currently on the council, told The Stranger. Rinck wasn’t alone in her exasperation. Backlash was swift from renters’ rights and anti-displacement advocates, who saw the absences as yet another attempt to stall a process neglected for nearly a year and a half under Moore’s leadership. During that time, ten of the commission’s fifteen seats went unfilled and nominees received no hearings, even as Moore attempted to advance legislation to roll back tenant protections. “To fail to appoint commissioners in the last scheduled committee meeting before recess is to undermine not only that group’s ability to convene and meaningfully carry out its role: it is to contribute to the sense that ‘government’ has no interest in solving problems of the people, by the people, and for the people,” Alison Eisinger, Executive Director of the Seattle/King County Coalition on Homelessness, wrote in an email to Solomon, Saka, and Nelson after last week’s debacle. Commission confirmations are now scheduled to take place at Tuesday’s full council meeting, along with other business that was delayed due to the absences, including appointments to the Disability Commission. Eisinger had previously pressed Moore on the need to schedule confirmations, calling her refusal to do so a “counterproductive approach to engaging constituents in the work of understanding and addressing the issues and needs of more than 50% of Seattle residents who are renters.” Solomon, who represents South Seattle on the council, says that’s why Tuesday’s meeting is all the more urgent: “That gives us a way forward to seat these folks … we owe it to them to listen and make it happen.” In statements, both Nelson and Saka acknowledged the frustration caused by their absences. For Kate Rubin, a commissioner whose term expired in February and who is seeking reappointment on Tuesday, their excuses rang hollow. “I absolutely believe it was deliberate,” Rubin says. “The email from former Councilmember Moore at 2:30 in the morning confirms it.” The recently resigned Moore’s email directly urged Saka, Nelson, and Solomon to delay the vote, though she later told the Seattle Times that her email to Solomon bounced back. “Beyond that, there’s just been a dismissive attitude toward the Renters Commission since this new council took office,” Rubin says. For renters’ rights advocates, it’s difficult not to interpret last week’s absences, Moore’s witching-hour email lobbying, and her earlier pushes to rollback renter protections and to remake the Renters Commission to include landlords—a shift Rubin says would further muffle the voices of a rental population that now outnumbers homeowners—as anything but a ploy to run out the clock before Moore’s replacement, Debora Juarez, takes office risking further delays in seating the commission. While the Renters Commission is technically advisory, it does weigh in on appointments to Seattle’s Social Housing Authority—the public developer tasked with building, owning, and maintaining permanently affordable mixed-income housing. The council’s conservative bloc has historically resisted Social Housing, pushing an alternative tax measure last year in opposition to it. Rubin says that without the backlash, she doubts the council would have moved with such urgency, fast‑tracking the confirmation for Tuesday instead of letting it languish. Though she’s hopeful it will finally bring long-overdue confirmations, she’s clear that the work is barely beginning. Seattle’s average rent hit $2,110 last month—30 percent higher than the national average, leaving the city among the country’s priciest rental markets. “Fully fund tenant services,” Rubin says. “The people supporting renters are underpaid, overworked, and burning out. Engage renters more in decisions that affect them, not just during 9-to-5 public comment. And create real accountability for landlords. Right now, code enforcement is complaint-based, and landlords can get away with violations just by stopping when they’re caught. Renters deserve a system that actually protects them.” In short, even if all confirmations on the day go forward, it isn’t the finish line. It’s the bare minimum. And if the council can’t manage even that, what hope is there for a city where renters are already running out of money, patience, and most of all, time?",,"['mayor', 'city council', 'councilmember', 'housing', 'homelessness', 'legislation', 'city council (title)']",15.5,2025-08-03T16:25:54.239263,6455

Mayor Bruce Harrell’s office is explaining away his comments praising Elon Musk and other MAGA-aligned tech leaders last week while addressing the city’s business community at the annual “State of Downtown” gathering. “The mayor was not praising them, he was referencing they have an objective reputation as leaders in technology and innovation, and that it is a danger they are in the president’s orbit,” the mayor’s spokesperson told Publicola trying to explain the praise. “We know that our current president surrounds himself by some of the smartest innovators around,” Harrell said as he veered off script in his business-friendly speech at the Downtown Seattle Association event. “When we drop names like Andreessen or Peter Thiel or David Sacks or Elon Musk, these are smart innovators.” The nuanced praise for Musk in the shadow of his Department of Government Efficiency work to gut major areas of the federal government and his increased efforts supporting right wing campaigns around the globe comes as Harrell is shaping his reelection campaign with themes around “common values,” “public safety solutions,” and “proven leadership to stand up for our values.” With his job going up for a vote, the veteran Seattle politician does not seem interested at this point in engaging in extra tangles with the Trump administration — though his office said the mayor “certainly doesn’t agree with their politics” in the statement provided to media in the wake of last week’s Downtown Seattle Association speech. It will be a tricky row to hoe for Seattle leaders facing reelection in 2025. Monday morning, City Attorney Ann Davison, who ran for Lt. Governor as a Republican in 2020, released a statement calling Seattle a “Welcoming City,” avoiding the “Sanctuary City” label championed in past battles with Trump over immigration, as she announced Seattle will join San Francisco, Portland, “and many other jurisdictions across the country” in filing suit against the Trump administration over its threats to cut to cut federal resources to cities “that do not conduct federal immigration enforcement.” “It is not against the law to be a welcoming city. For more than 20 years, the City of Seattle, by ordinance, has directed its employees to not inquire about a person’s immigration status, absent a legal obligation to do so,” the Davison statement reads. “It is well within our authority to direct our employees in this manner.” Davison announced in January she would seek reelection joining public safety collaborators Harrell and City Council president Sara Nelson on the Seattle campaign trail. In the mayor’s race, meanwhile, none of the candidates lining up to oppose Harrell at this point have the mayor’s name recognition but one of them is being very straightforward in their approach to Making America Great Again. “Calling all MAGA Republicans in WA State. We need your help from outside the blue city,” Harrell challenger and Capitol Hill shop owner Rachael Savage pleaded on social media this week seeking financial support for her campaign. CHS reported here on Savage’s campaign launch as a Republican for the non-partisan mayor’s office as the candidate is promising to lead an end to “the addiction and mental illness epidemic” with a major crackdown in which the city’s police and prosecutors “arrest, charge and convict every person committing crimes on the streets of Seattle no matter how small those crimes are.” $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

Last week in a press conference to tout the success of SPD’s Real Time Crime Center, Harrell’s office said the mayor backs an expansion of a pilot program that already has cameras along Aurora Ave, 3rd Ave, and in the International District to include areas around Cal Anderson and Pike/Pine. The mayor’s office is also backing expansion of the 24×7 surveillance program to include the area around Garfield High School where the city and the district are spending thousands on security upgrades and community services to counter deadly gun violence that has marred the campus. Garfield is also being considered for a pilot program beginning this fall that would pay for a Seattle Police School Engagement Officer on the campus. The Harrell administration says it recently proposed legislation to the Seattle City Council that would expand “the geographic areas where City CCTV cameras can be installed, including public streets and sidewalks around Garfield and Nova High Schools, the Capitol Hill Nightlife District, and the SODO Stadium Area,” according to a statement from City Hall. “The legislation also authorizes the RTCC to view and record SDOT traffic cameras at select intersections and along major arterial roads in the city,” the mayor’s office adds. (Image: City of Seattle) The proposed expansion comes as Harrell and new SPD Chief Shon Barnes touted the early success of the RTCC and the pilot creating the new SPD surveillance system combining Closed-Circuit Television Camera systems above the city’s streets with “real-time crime center” software.after only two months of operation. The city says the new system “integrates various video and data streams for enhanced analysis and investigation of crime incidents.” Since its launch on May 20, the upgraded center has played a role in investigating 600 reported incidents and was currently supporting 90 active criminal investigations, officials said last week. According to the city, RTCC analysts provide patrol officers and detectives with incident details, video images, and other relevant information, “often as incidents are happening.” “RTCC analysts can communicate directly with officers in the field via police radio channels,” the city says. “During a recent gun violence incident near Aurora Avenue North, RTCC analysts used CCTV cameras to observe the shooting suspect, send an image of the suspect to responding patrol officers, and then advise officers of the escape route that the offender was taking.” SPD first rolled out the RTCC in 2015 funded through a $411,000 Department of Justice grant. The mayor hasn’t put a public price tag on the new upgraded capabilities of Seattle’s RTCC or the proposed surveillance camera expansions. The addition of the initial set of Aurora, 3rd Ave, and ID cameras was reported as $1.8 million. “Our Real Time Crime Center is already proving to be a vital tool in solving crimes and improving public safety across the city, supporting hundreds of investigations and accountability for dangerous offenders,” Harrell said in a statement. “By investing in and leveraging evidence-based technology, we’re giving our officers the resources they need to respond effectively while ensuring these tools are used responsibly and with strong safeguards. Public safety remains our top priority, and this initiative shows our commitment to creating safer neighborhoods for everyone in Seattle.” “Our Real Time Crime Center is already proving to be a vital tool in solving crimes and improving public safety across the city, supporting hundreds of investigations and accountability for dangerous offenders,” said Mayor Harrell. “By investing in and leveraging evidence-based technology, we’re giving our officers the resources they need to respond effectively while ensuring these tools are used responsibly and with strong safeguards. Public safety remains our top priority, and this initiative shows our commitment to creating safer neighborhoods for everyone in Seattle.” In the East Precinct, SPD has focused on drug issues and street disorder centered around Pike and Broadway and the area around Cal Anderson and Deputy Mayor Burgess’s renewed efforts sparked by neighborhood outcry — and a key email from a neighborhood developer — over an October murder on 11th Ave. (Image: City of Seattle) Burgess said earlier this year his office was working on a plan to add the area around Cal Anderson and Pike/Pine identified by SPD as a trouble zone for drug crimes and street disorder to the anti-crime camera system pilot being rolled out in the area around Aurora Ave N, the International District including Little Saigon, and the 3rd Ave corridor downtown. Other City Hall initiatives including one of its biggest haven’t made much of an impact. CHS reported here on the so far rarely used Capitol Hill Stay Out of Drug Area and the first recipient of a banishment order for the zone. Meanwhile, in the Central District, the 2024/2025 school year at Garfield High School began with new efforts around gun concerns at the 23rd Ave campus and across the city as Seattle officials led by Harrell announced a $14.5 million plan focused on intervention, mental health, and increased use of “school-based safety specialist” private security guards following the deadly lunchtime shooting of teen Amarr Murphy-Paine in June 2024 in the Garfield campus parking lot. The timeline for expanding the cameras to Pike/Pine and 23rd Ave is not clear as chair Bob Kettle must now move the legislation forward with the council’s public safety committee. Harrell, meanwhile, is engaged in a closer than expected race with challenger Katie Wilson as the August 5th primary approaches. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

KUOW reported new details this week from a 1996 incident where the then 37-year-old lawyer working in Nebraska pulled a gun on a man and a woman in a dispute over a parking spot at an Iowa casino. “We was like, ‘What the hell is going on?!” the woman, who was eight months pregnant at the time, told KUOW recalling the incident 30 years later. “It scared us.” KUOW broke the story on Harrell’s 1996 arrest in February but the new reporting provides perspective from the couple on other end of the dispute and details how the case was dismissed and never addressed as Harrell rose at City Hall as a member of the city council and then Seattle’s mayor. The small incident made news at the time, KUOW reports, because Harrell had been appointed to a housing authority board in Omaha. Harrell admitted to “displaying a gun” but said it was because of death threats he received after the appointment. After he was arrested and booked in the gun incident, KUOW says Harrell removed his name for consideration for the board. The case, however, was eventually dropped. Harrell’s spokesperson told KUOW this week the mayor was the victim. “In some ways, this was an introduction to the hostilities the mayor would receive as a public servant, and reminiscent of the treatment and bigotry he has received throughout his life as a biracial person by people of all races and backgrounds who see him as different,” the spokesperson told KUOW. The spokesperson told KUOW Harrell hired a law firm in 1996 “to write to the casino that Harrell’s constitutional rights were violated because of ‘unreasonable search and seizures based on racial profiling'” but no lawsuit was filed. The controversy over the incident is tempered by time and distance but will be another talking point in the 2025 election season. CHS reported here on the challenges Harrell and other Seattle incumbents face standing strong against the Trump administration while also not attracting vindictive attention from Washington D.C. Harrell is shaping his reelection campaign with themes around “common values,” “public safety solutions,” and “proven leadership to stand up for our values.” So far, his field of challengers is limited to candidates with little or no political experience in the city. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

Mayor Bruce Harrell has issued an executive order “Supporting and Expediting Sound Transit 3 Investments in the City of Seattle” hoped to help speed construction of new light rail connections to Ballard and West Seattle. Harrell, fresh off the annual “state of the city” address in which he put forward a raft of urbanist and growth initiatives to join his continued messages around addressing public safety and downtown business concerns as he seeks reelection, said his office “will lead the development of and transmit to the City Council legislation to streamline the permit process for this major project,” saying the city will consider “land use code changes, formal adoption of ST3 projects, and supportive property transactions” to “speed up light rail delivery” of the highly anticipated new connections. Let’s check in with the locals. “It still is short on actual details of what kind of zoning changes will be proposed, among other things, saying only ‘In 2025 and 2026, my administration will develop several bodies of legislation, including land use code amendments, formal adoption of the ST3 projects, and necessary real property transactions to allow the projects to proceed as quickly as possible,'” the West Seattle Blog reports, adding that the order “also says that while there’s currently a team with 20 full-time city employees focused on ST3 (the ballot measure that included the West Seattle/Ballard extensions), that will be multiplied.” My Ballard focuses on the money. “To keep the project on track, the City is allocating $5.2 million in 2025 and $6.8 million in 2026 to hire up to 50 additional staff members to focus on design, permitting, construction, and station planning,” My Ballard reports. “The expanded office will also create a four-year plan to ensure safe, accessible stations with thoughtful design, improved access routes, safety measures, and equitable development around transit hubs.” The current timeline calls for the nearly 8 mile light rail extension to Ballard to open by 2039. My Ballard says it will include nine new stations, in addition the needed second downtown transit tunnel, and a Salmon Bay crossing. The West Seattle link will be half as long and is currently planned to be fully delivered by 2032. It is projected to cost between $6.7 and $7.1 billion. The Ballard extension? It is forecasted to cost more than $11 billion. Both extensions were part of the $53.8 billion Sound Transit 3 tax package approved by voters in 2016. Meanwhile, testing efforts — and frequent service disruptions — continue as Sound Transit prepares to open Judkins Park Station and the complete 2 Line light rail system connecting Seattle and the Eastside via I-90 by “late” 2025. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

https://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2025/05/seattle-police-clear-sunbathers-at-denny-blaine-park/,Capitol Hill Seattle,"CHS Capitol Hill Seattle News Seattle Police clear sunbathers at Denny Blaine Park — UPDATE: Mayor, Hollingsworth respond LATEST CHS SUBSCRIBER TOTAL: 1,236","Police were at Denny Blaine Sunday(Image: @mom_calls_me_myrtle) A police officer “on a premise” assignment at Denny Blaine Park caused a stir Sunday at the nude beach east on the shores of Lake Washington. The Seattle Police Department is apparently cracking down on the popular Capitol Hill sunny day getaway. Reports describe multiple police officers called to the scene Sunday telling afternoon park goers to cover up and trespassing one sunbather who refused, according to Colleen Kimseylove of the Friends of Denny Blaine Park community group that has been trying to find solutions that protect the park’s history and place in Seattle queer culture while also placating increasing hostile neighbors in the wealthy neighborhood that surrounds the nude-friendly beach and park that has been affectionately known as Dykiki for decades. “When Kimseylove arrived, they spoke to SPD Officer Ella Brooks who told Kimseylove that no Seattle law protects nudity, and if someone called and complained, SPD officers had to respond,” independent Seattle news site The Burner reports. “The cops also told Kimseylove that someone had directed SPD to routinely check in on the park. They told Kimseylove that people needed to put their clothes on or be trespassed or potentially arrested.” SPD reportedly told one sunbather who argued with officers Sunday they were banned from the park for the week. The department has not publicly provided details of the order. Seattle Parks, whose Park Rangers are authorized to formally trespass individuals for breaking park rules, says it issued no trespasses at the park this weekend. The police presence at the park began just before 2:30 PM Sunday when an officer checked in on East Precinct radio “on a premise” in Denny Blaine Park. Less than five minutes into the beat, she called in for a supervisor. While an officer reporting in “on a premise” can have multiple meanings, it typically indicates an officer is beginning a patrol at an assigned location. Officers check in this way, for example, when SPD is conducting emphasis patrols at specific locations like a school or a business. CHS asked SPD for more information about the incident that followed, the reported trespass, and the premise assignment but the department has not yet responded. The Burner reports it has been told that neighbors have also hired private security to keep watch on the park and deal with police. The apparent crackdown follows filing a lawsuit from unnamed park neighbors demanding the city address concerns at Denny Blaine over “public masturbation, public sex and other types of indecent exposure, drug use, unlawful public nudity, environmental damage to the shoreline, and scofflaw parking.” The suit all but ends any chance at goodwill and compromise the Friends of Denny Blaine group has been forging. The group has been meeting regularly to find community solutions that also protect the park’s place with queer and nudist communities. The friends group successfully pushed back in 2023 on a plan quietly shepherded by Mayor Bruce Harrell to add a children’s playground to the park with the help of a no longer-anonymous donation from Denny Blaine neighbor and Seattle mall developer Stuart Sloan. Sunday, meanwhile, is not the first time officials have tried to change behavior at Denny Blaine. Seattle Parks has tried here and there over the years to timidly suggest sunbathers cover up but never before with cops threatening arrest. Given the city and SPD’s silence on the matter so far, it may not be the last. Sunday’s weather was 60 F and breezy. Tuesday, highs are predicted to approach 80 F before a bout of rain hits the city this weekend. UPDATE: We’ve also reached out to District 3 representative and chair of the city council’s parks committee Joy Hollingsworth to learn more about what is being done to protect community use of the park and will update when we hear back. UPDATE x2: Hollingsworth declined to comment at this time. “Once we receive more information and facts, we will have a better understanding of the situation,” the council member said. UPDATE x3 5/7/2025 8 AM: Hollingsworth says she is “continuing to closely monitor the situation at Denny Blaine Park, particularly in light of the events that took place last Sunday.” In a statement posted Tuesday on social media, Hollingsworth, who is gay, said she recognizes “the deep significance of Denny Blaine to our LGBTQ+ community” and is “committed to preserving and protecting safe, inclusive public spaces for all.” Hollingsworth, chair of the council’s parks committee, says she has been in “active communication” with the Seattle Police Department, Seattle Parks and Recreation, and the Mayor’s Office about the Sunday enforcement, and expressed her concerns over the situation, “underscoring the need for a thoughtful, community-centered approach moving forward.” SPD’s enforcement efforts don’t seem to fit that approach. For now, Hollingsworth is still talking compromise. “My ongoing hope—and priority—is that we can collaboratively develop a solution that respects the park’s unique heritage while ensuring the safety, dignity, and well-being of everyone who visits,” she concludes. Katie Wilson, who is challenging incumbent Bruce Harrell for the Seattle Mayor’s office this year, also added her voice to the condemnation of SPD’s actions, calling the actions a seeming “Plan B” after efforts to change Denny Blaine like plans for the playground were scuttled. “As I’ve been talking with voters around the City, I hear again and again that people want a police force that is adequately staffed but also responsive, trustworthy, and accountable to the communities it serves,” Wilson said in her updates on social media. “It was jarring to read this story about Denny Blaine just after a grocery worker told me about nearly being stabbed on the job and then waiting a very, very long time for police to arrive. What are our priorities? Why are we sending police to harass harmless people hanging out at a queer nude beach?” “Of course, we know why,” she writes. “Because wealthy neighbors don’t want those people there. Just like they wanted the City to build a playground at Denny Blaine to drive them out. And Mayor Harrell’s administration was all set to oblige— until the community organized & pushed back.” “It’s hard to avoid the suspicion that this police prodding is Plan B,” Wilson said. “And it certainly sounds like this strategy is coming from the top. It is mind-boggling that with the multiple major challenges and crises our city is facing, this is what we’re doing.” Harrell, who said he shared “disgust” over the complaints of nudity and lewd behavior at the park in text messages revealed last year, has not yet publicly responded to the Sunday SPD enforcement at the park. UPDATE x4 5/7/2025 9:50 AM: In a statement, the his office say Mayor Harrell has not “directed a change to SPD patrols or approach to enforcement at Denny Blaine Park.” “As we’ve said before, Mayor Harrell recognizes that people have a right to use the park nude under State law,” a spokesperson said. The spokesperson told CHS the mayor’s office would need to “defer to SPD on the details of specific events or any individual enforcement actions taken.” SPD’s communications team has not replied to CHS’s previous inquiries about the situation. We have added them to our conversation with the mayor’s office. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

Council President Ashley Martin stood nervously at the front of the crowded room at Grace United Methodist Church, wringing a copy of the council’s newsletter, The Leschi News, in her hands. “So to address the elephant in the room…” Martin began, explaining that this was originally planned as a neighborhood Q&A with Seattle Police Department Chief Shon Barnes. “This was also posted as this is a forum to discuss the situation, I’m not even going to try and describe the right word for it, at Denny Blaine Park.” Martin decided the first half of the meeting would stick to the original agenda and the second half would be devoted to the “situation.” Just who was here to ask Barnes about the “situation” was visually obvious. The people with the signs and colorful hair wanted to know: Why did three of his officers make a bunch of legally nude people put their clothes on at a queer nude beach on Sunday and kicked out a trans woman who refused to get dressed? But first, a brief (roughly twenty-minute) introduction. After discussing his history as a teacher turned cop, his wife, who’s a doctor, and three kids still back in the midwest, and his lonely home life in Seattle without them, Barnes took questions. He had just started answering one about the Before the Badge training program when Chavisa Woods, who lives in Leschi and has gone to Denny Blaine with her partner for 12 years, lost patience. “Half of us are here to talk about Denny Blaine, and you said we’d get time for that,” Woods says. “You told us about your college major before you got to Denny Blaine,” someone says. “You said we would get to Denny Blaine first.” “No no,” President Martin says, now seated at a table at the front of the room. “I said we were going to get to the original intent of the meeting first.” “Respectfully,” Woods says over the babble. “They are cracking down on queer bodies and raiding queer spaces,” Woods says. After about twenty more minutes of questions, Woods was called on. “We sat here politely and listened to you talk about how great the police are, but a lot of us have never had that experience,” Woods says. “I would like to know why it’s okay for the police to come to queer spaces and start cracking down on people for public nudity, which is not even illegal in the city of Seattle.” “Is nudity illegal?” says a man at the back with long grey hair. “That’s the first question.” “No,” people groan and yell at him. Barnes finally pipes up. “So being nude is free expression, not illegal,” he says. “Not illegal. Let me explain to you what happened.” Barnes explained that the officers were receiving complaints about nudity and masturbation, which Barnes (hilariously) called “activity that may shock the conscience.” The officers had been instructed to patrol the park in search of said shocking acts, Barnes says, but “mistakenly they were wrong” when they asked people to put their clothes on. Barnes was explaining that the trans woman was issued a code of conduct violation and told not to come back to the beach for a week when that woman, standing in the back of the room, interrupted him. “It was a business card!” she says. “That’s what they gave me.” “And to correct you,” says Colleen Kimseylove, co-leader of the park stewardship group Friends of Denny Blaine. “The officer trespassed the woman for being naked. We have photo evidence, she’s laying down, she’s doing nothing.” “It is my understanding that that will be rescinded, alright,” Barnes says. “Am I allowed at the park or not?” says the woman in the back. “Yes,” Barnes says. People clapped. Later, someone in the crowd asked him to say sorry. “I did that.” “I was detained!” the woman says. “That’s not a thing that you apologized for.” “That’s something you get sued for,” someone quips. “Well, we don’t comment on pending lawsuits,” Barnes says. (It’s unclear if there is a pending suit, or if Barnes was saying he couldn’t comment on the prospect of being sued. SPD told The Stranger they're unaware of any pending lawsuits.) At the end of the meeting, Barnes apologized to anyone who “may have been offended” by his officers misinterpreting the law. “We’re not perfect,” he says. Sunday’s “mistake” came shortly after a neighbors group, Denny Blaine Park for All, sued the city for allegedly allowing the beach to turn into a den of cum and villainy where public sex and masturbation were supposedly commonplace. Masturbation surely happens at Denny Blaine as it does at our city’s many beautiful parks, as well as on our buses and street corners, but the more than 50 beachgoers who’ve spoken to The Stranger about Denny Blaine in the last year and half say the neighbors’ characterization is overblown. Masturbation is anathema at Denny Blaine, and beachgoers kick people out when they see it. Kimseylove, who is holding an intervention training at the beach on May 18, says they suspect neighbors are reporting masturbation in places like the parking lot where beachgoers aren’t even aware it’s happening. But the suit isn’t just going after illegal public masturbation, it alleges that legal nudity violates the Parks Department’s code of conduct because it’s depriving them enjoyment of the beach. The beachgoers just see it as the latest scheme to kick them out. Before the suit, an anonymous donor (later unmasked by the millionaire owner of University Village and next door neighbor to Denny Blaine Park Stuart Sloan, also part of the group that filed the suit) hatched a $1 million plan to build a children’s playground at the beach. Before that plan went public in the fall 2023, Sloan vented his frustrations about nudity in text messages to Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell’s private cell phone. He sent the Mayor photos of naked people on the beach, which he called “DISGUSTING.” Harrell promised Sloan that deputy Mayor (now SDOT Director) Adiam Emery would help him. Emery and Seattle Parks Department employees met with Sloan for months, even reviewing plans for the park. After a lively and loud public meeting in December 2023, where dozens said the beach was a place of freedom and safety, Parks cancelled the playground. Public records show Harrell met with Sloan twice, including the day after the city announced the plan was dead, but maintained he never knew the donor’s identity. In the first few months of 2024, beachgoers and neighbors tried to hash out a solution to end the conflict for good, but nothing really came of the talks. Lately though, the city has paid Denny Blaine extra attention. As The Stranger reported Monday, in March, Seattle Park Rangers told a nude sunbather to either get dressed or move closer to the water where he couldn’t be seen from the street. In April, police showed up at least two times as part of the patrols Barnes mentioned last night. Blake Waddell, a beach regular there both times, says one officer told him higher ups were directing the patrols. A sergeant told Kimseylove the same thing at the beach Sunday. (In all these cases, no lewd behavior was found). Waddell, who was also at the beach Sunday, says he filed a complaint with a sergeant on the spot. In an email, Harrell’s office denied directing SPD to change its approach at Denny Blaine. The Seattle Parks Department says Park Rangers have routinely stopped by Denny Blaine since March 2024 and that there’s been no change to policy. According to the lawsuit, neighbors met with City Councilmember Joy Hollingsworth three times last year. Two months ago, after Hollingsworth talked about the meetings on the podcast Seattle Nice, she told The Stranger neighbors had asked park rangers to look out for masturbation, but that there was no plan for that. Hollingsworth told The Stranger by text Monday night that she had no comment on the Sunday incident, but then posted to X that she and her staff were monitoring the “situation” and were in active communication with SPD, the Parks Department, and the Mayor’s Office about what happened. Barnes says he’s working with Hollingsworth to set up meetings between SPD and the city’s queer community. Hollingsworth also recently met with Friends of Denny Blaine. “My ongoing hope—and priority—is that we can collaboratively develop a solution that respects the park’s unique heritage while ensuring the safety, dignity, and well-being of everyone who visits,” Hollingsworth wrote. At last night’s meeting, Barnes said the “directed patrols” at Denny Blaine would end and that he’d bring in Park Rangers to figure out when it was appropriate to call the cops. Though, when The Stranger asked Parks about the rangers who told a man to put on his clothes, Parks said police would take the lead on complaints of lewd behavior from then on. One woman at the meeting said the cops hadn’t been of much help to beachgoers so far. She said beachgoers used to regularly call about a “predator” harassing women at the beach. When the cops came, they’d allegedly tell the women the man was harassing to put their clothes on. That man eventually pushed someone down the stairs, nearly killing them, she says. Barnes said he wanted to follow up on that. A man with a coif of dark hair named Michael asked Barnes if his officers would now know nudity was legal in the park and would “never again harass someone for simply being in the buff.” “I will make sure that everyone understands that nudity is legal,” Barnes says. “But I will not, I could not commit to saying never about anything. I don’t know why they may be there. They may be there for something totally unrelated and it gets attributed to that.” “That’s, that’s not the question,” someone says. “Well, then that’s the answer,” Barnes says. “Next question.” When a woman asked what she should do the next time a police officer told her to get dressed at Denny Blaine, Barnes said she could remind them nudity is “free expression” in the city of Seattle, the exact thing beachgoers did Sunday. “Can we say that you told us it was okay?” she asked. If he answered, laughter and applause drowned it out. “We are committed to working with you,” Barnes says, after shooting down Kimseylove’s request for another half hour of questions. “I don’t want anyone to walk out of here, number one, thinking you have a police department that doesn’t support who you are … Lastly, let me say this, this conversation is not over.” Kimseylove wasn’t thrilled with Barnes. “I think that was a show of nonsense,” Kimseylove says, frustrated that Barnes did not make more time for questions and left open the ambiguous possibility of future enforcement. “If there is an incident, you are the one with the data, the resources, the money, the information to figure out a way to make sure it doesn’t happen again. The only variable we are asking you to control, Seattle Police Department, is your own employees.” That much he could have committed to, Kimseylove says. Four others who spoke with The Stranger weren’t confident this was truly over either. It wasn’t the meeting the Leschi Community Council thought it would be. Council President Ashley Martin stood nervously at the front of the crowded room at Grace United Methodist Church, wringing a copy of the council’s newsletter, The Leschi News, in her hands. “So to address the elephant in the room…” Martin began, explaining that this was originally planned as a neighborhood Q&A with Seattle Police Department Chief Shon Barnes. “This was also posted as this is a forum to discuss the situation, I’m not even going to try and describe the right word for it, at Denny Blaine Park.” Martin decided the first half of the meeting would stick to the original agenda and the second half would be devoted to the “situation.” Just who was here to ask Barnes about the “situation” was visually obvious. The people with the signs and colorful hair wanted to know: Why did three of his officers make a bunch of legally nude people put their clothes on at a queer nude beach on Sunday and kicked out a trans woman who refused to get dressed? But first, a brief (roughly twenty-minute) introduction. After discussing his history as a teacher turned cop, his wife, who’s a doctor, and three kids still back in the midwest, and his lonely home life in Seattle without them, Barnes took questions. He had just started answering one about the Before the Badge training program when Chavisa Woods, who lives in Leschi and has gone to Denny Blaine with her partner for 12 years, lost patience. “Half of us are here to talk about Denny Blaine, and you said we’d get time for that,” Woods says. “You told us about your college major before you got to Denny Blaine,” someone says. “You said we would get to Denny Blaine first.” “No no,” President Martin says, now seated at a table at the front of the room. “I said we were going to get to the original intent of the meeting first.” “Respectfully,” Woods says over the babble. “They are cracking down on queer bodies and raiding queer spaces,” Woods says. After about twenty more minutes of questions, Woods was called on. “We sat here politely and listened to you talk about how great the police are, but a lot of us have never had that experience,” Woods says. “I would like to know why it’s okay for the police to come to queer spaces and start cracking down on people for public nudity, which is not even illegal in the city of Seattle.” “Is nudity illegal?” says a man at the back with long grey hair. “That’s the first question.” “No,” people groan and yell at him. Barnes finally pipes up. “So being nude is free expression, not illegal,” he says. “Not illegal. Let me explain to you what happened.” Barnes explained that the officers were receiving complaints about nudity and masturbation, which Barnes (hilariously) called “activity that may shock the conscience.” The officers had been instructed to patrol the park in search of said shocking acts, Barnes says, but “mistakenly they were wrong” when they asked people to put their clothes on. Barnes was explaining that the trans woman was issued a code of conduct violation and told not to come back to the beach for a week when that woman, standing in the back of the room, interrupted him. “It was a business card!” she says. “That’s what they gave me.” “And to correct you,” says Colleen Kimseylove, co-leader of the park stewardship group Friends of Denny Blaine. “The officer trespassed the woman for being naked. We have photo evidence, she’s laying down, she’s doing nothing.” “It is my understanding that that will be rescinded, alright,” Barnes says. “Am I allowed at the park or not?” says the woman in the back. “Yes,” Barnes says. People clapped. Later, someone in the crowd asked him to say sorry. “I did that.” “I was detained!” the woman says. “That’s not a thing that you apologized for.” “That’s something you get sued for,” someone quips. “Well, we don’t comment on pending lawsuits,” Barnes says. (It’s unclear if there is a pending suit, or if Barnes was saying he couldn’t comment on the prospect of being sued. SPD told The Stranger they're unaware of any pending lawsuits.) At the end of the meeting, Barnes apologized to anyone who “may have been offended” by his officers misinterpreting the law. “We’re not perfect,” he says. Sunday’s “mistake” came shortly after a neighbors group, Denny Blaine Park for All, sued the city for allegedly allowing the beach to turn into a den of cum and villainy where public sex and masturbation were supposedly commonplace. Masturbation surely happens at Denny Blaine as it does at our city’s many beautiful parks, as well as on our buses and street corners, but the more than 50 beachgoers who’ve spoken to The Stranger about Denny Blaine in the last year and half say the neighbors’ characterization is overblown. Masturbation is anathema at Denny Blaine, and beachgoers kick people out when they see it. Kimseylove, who is holding an intervention training at the beach on May 18, says they suspect neighbors are reporting masturbation in places like the parking lot where beachgoers aren’t even aware it’s happening. But the suit isn’t just going after illegal public masturbation, it alleges that legal nudity violates the Parks Department’s code of conduct because it’s depriving them enjoyment of the beach. The beachgoers just see it as the latest scheme to kick them out. Before the suit, an anonymous donor (later unmasked by the millionaire owner of University Village and next door neighbor to Denny Blaine Park Stuart Sloan, also part of the group that filed the suit) hatched a $1 million plan to build a children’s playground at the beach. Before that plan went public in the fall 2023, Sloan vented his frustrations about nudity in text messages to Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell’s private cell phone. He sent the Mayor photos of naked people on the beach, which he called “DISGUSTING.” Harrell promised Sloan that deputy Mayor (now SDOT Director) Adiam Emery would help him. Emery and Seattle Parks Department employees met with Sloan for months, even reviewing plans for the park. After a lively and loud public meeting in December 2023, where dozens said the beach was a place of freedom and safety, Parks cancelled the playground. Public records show Harrell met with Sloan twice, including the day after the city announced the plan was dead, but maintained he never knew the donor’s identity. In the first few months of 2024, beachgoers and neighbors tried to hash out a solution to end the conflict for good, but nothing really came of the talks. Lately though, the city has paid Denny Blaine extra attention. As The Stranger reported Monday, in March, Seattle Park Rangers told a nude sunbather to either get dressed or move closer to the water where he couldn’t be seen from the street. In April, police showed up at least two times as part of the patrols Barnes mentioned last night. Blake Waddell, a beach regular there both times, says one officer told him higher ups were directing the patrols. A sergeant told Kimseylove the same thing at the beach Sunday. (In all these cases, no lewd behavior was found). Waddell, who was also at the beach Sunday, says he filed a complaint with a sergeant on the spot. In an email, Harrell’s office denied directing SPD to change its approach at Denny Blaine. The Seattle Parks Department says Park Rangers have routinely stopped by Denny Blaine since March 2024 and that there’s been no change to policy. According to the lawsuit, neighbors met with City Councilmember Joy Hollingsworth three times last year.

Tuesday night’s Young Democrats at UW Candidate Forum will be broadcast online. Check out @youngdemocrats_uw for details and links. Seattle’s 2025 races for mayor, city attorney, and three seats on the city council will involve Seattle’s wall of mostly moderate Democrat incumbents facing challenges from the left — and a few from the right. One Capitol Hill-based political opponent to Mayor Bruce Harrell won’t be taking him on in the primary. Broadway boutique-owner and Republican neighborhood activist Rachael Savage has opted to file to be part of the race to challenge Alexis Mercedes Rinck for her citywide Position 8 seat on the city council. CHS asked Savage about the change after months of fundraising built around her planned challenge to Harrell. The mayor’s race has drawn eight other challengers to Harrell, however. CHS reported here on the campaign launch earlier this year for progressive activist Katie Wilson who has worked with organizations like the Transit Riders Union, and helped lead minimum wage and renter rights campaigns around the region. On the other side of the spectrum, business friendly candidate and former T-Mobile executive Joe Mallahan is back for a reheat more than a decade after he and Mike McGinn knocked incumbent Greg Nickels out in the city’s 2009 primary. McGinn, of course, battled with Mallahan over things like the plans for the First Hill Streetcar but went on to easy victory that fall. The Savage campaign says the arrival of Mallahan in the race signaled its exit, saying the “last minute entry of millionaire candidate into the race changed the math.” Now, the Savage campaign folks say they have a “winnable race” lined up for the council.

Trump Hangs up Faster Than You Can Say “Flight Log”: Despite Speaker Johnson abruptly shutting down the House, this scandal just won’t die. Turns out Donald Trump was personally told by Attorney General Pam Bondi back in May that his name pops up multiple times in the Epstein files—the very same files the feds promised to release before pulling a hard U-turn. According to The Wall Street Journal, both Bondi and FBI-director-loyalist Kash Patel warned Trump, brushing off the mentions as “unverified hearsay” about his old Epstein hangouts. And Trump? He responded the way any totally innocent person would: by hanging up on CNN. With even some House Republicans now backing Dems to get those files out in the open and Ghislaine Maxwell freshly subpoenaed, the Epstein vortex is sucking DC back into its sleaze orbit. Trump, reportedly “furious,” says there are way more important stories—like his latest attempt to accuse Obama of treason. Uh huh… Gaza Is Starving While World Leaders Stall: While world leaders churn out limp press releases and squabble over phantom “humanitarian corridors,” more than 100 aid organizations are shouting what should already be unbearable to ignore: Gaza is starving, and Israel’s blockade is to blame. In a searing joint statement titled “As Mass Starvation Spreads Across Gaza, Our Colleagues and Those We Serve Are Wasting Away,” they describe skeletal children, aid workers collapsing from hunger, and food distribution sites turned into massacre zones. As of July 13, more than 875 Palestinians have been killed while seeking food. Meanwhile, trucks packed with food, clean water, and medicine sit idle just outside Gaza—trapped by a siege designed not to fail, but to punish. “Each morning, the same question echoes across Gaza: will I eat today?” one agency rep said. The answer, too often, is no. This isn’t just a famine. It’s a war crime, and every day the world delays, more lives are lost to the politics of cruelty. Hellfire Roast: Turns out Starbucks isn’t just serving up venti-sized lattes—it’s pouring out infernal levels of executive greed. Per the AFL-CIO’s new Executive Paywatch report, CEO Brian Niccol made 6,666 times more than the company’s typical worker last year. That’s right: six-six-six-six—a number so cursed it practically demands a goat sacrifice. While Niccol sipped nearly $98 million in compensation, the average barista scraped by on less than $15K. Starbucks claims this is because many workers are part-time, but that hasn’t stopped the company from dropping millions on union-busting lawyers and listening sessions instead of just, you know, paying people more. Workers have been striking, organizing, and dragging the company into court for years—meanwhile, Niccol’s getting a fat Trump-era tax cut on top of his stock-heavy bonus package. That mocha latte might taste a little more bitter now. The Government Just Ghosted Your Debt Relief: So, the Department of Education just hit pause on student loan forgiveness for folks in Income-Based Repayment plans. Which means if you’ve been grinding for years thinking you were finally done, the government’s like, “Actually, we need to recalculate your trauma first.” Interest kicks back in August 1, the tax break on forgiven debt expires in January, and a Trump administration, already hostile to student debt relief, most likely slow-walking the loan forgiveness process like it's a hostage negotiation. God forbid working people catch a break without crawling through a decade of red tape and moral judgment. Now, let us get into the tragicomedy that is our local news… Fergie Has Some ‘Splaining to Do: While Gov. Ferguson was thwarting taxes on billionaires last budget session, he somehow missed the stack of misconduct allegations piling up against his right-hand man, Mike Webb. Axios reports that although Webb resigned this year after multiple women accused him of creating a hostile work environment, red flags on the guy go back to 2013, with state auditors raising alarms as far back as 2019 with Ferguson’s office. The paraphrased response from Ferguson’s crew at the time? No formal HR complaint, so we’re good. Political code for “If you didn’t notarize your trauma, it doesn’t count.” And the kicker? Webb’s still tagging along and flying shotgun on campaign trips with Ferguson’s team as recently as last month. Apparently, in state politics, being a powerful creep doesn’t get you canceled. It gets you extra leg room. No Last Words, Just Lasting Rage: At his sentencing for the brutal murders of four University of Idaho students, Bryan Kohberger sat stone-faced and silent—offering zero explanation, zero remorse, and zero closure to the families he devastated. Prosecutors didn’t bother pushing for a plea deal that would force him to speak, because let’s be real: no one needed more self-serving nonsense from a guy who thinks silence makes him mysterious instead of monstrous. The Goncalves family, especially Kaylee’s sister Alivea, didn’t hold back—calling him “pathetic” and making it crystal clear he only succeeded because he attacked in the dark, like a coward. No motive, no mercy, no justice—just a courtroom full of grief staring down a man who will never give them what they actually deserve. Court Upholds Birthright Citizenship, for Now: A federal appeals court has ruled Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship unconstitutional, echoing a previous decision from a New Hampshire district court. Essentially, Terror 47 tried to rewrite the Constitution with magic marker, and the courts just reminded him that reality still exists. The ruling simply states what every exhausted civics teacher in America has been screaming into the void: you can’t undo the 14th Amendment just because it ruins your fascist fantasy. Washington was one of the states to bring the case against the administration. Fire in the Central District: A fire tore through Seattle’s Chinatown International Central District early Thursday, starting in a vacant home under construction and spreading to several neighboring homes, displacing multiple families. Thankfully, no residents were seriously hurt, although one firefighter was treated for minor injuries. The city is currently investigating the cause of the fire. Can’t Win in Court? Block the Judge: Municipal Court Judge Damon Shadid just dragged City Attorney Ann Davison’s office in open court for what looks like a power-hungry, politically motivated stunt—blocking Judge Pooja Vaddadi from hearing DUI and domestic violence cases based on what Vaddadi says are straight-up lies. Davison’s move, which sidelined a newly elected judge and basically turned a voter mandate into a desk job, has now triggered a formal bar complaint and serious questions about ethics, transparency, and who actually gets to wield power in Seattle’s justice system. And now, as Davison runs for reelection with MAGA baggage and a suddenly fat campaign account, she’s facing three challengers who seem more interested in actual justice than playing courtroom politics. Do Not Sign This Shit! In a raging case of voter suppression FOMO, Washington state conservatives are pushing a ballot initiative to literally gatekeep democracy. It's the bureaucratic equivalent of “Show us your papers, comrade,” as if the right to vote should come with a TSA checkpoint and a scavenger hunt for your birth certificate. No more checking a box. It would now be, prove you’re American enough, or get the hell out of the ballot line. Let’s just be real: the GOP doesn’t fear non-citizens voting. They fear citizens voting against them. If they can’t win your vote, they’ll sure as hell try to make it as hard as possible to vote in the first place. Waterfront Park Officially Opens: Our Emerald City officially unveiled its latest glow-up moment with the opening of the new Waterfront Park. Yes, 50,000 square feet of vibes where a collapsing highway used to loom like a concrete guillotine. After 15 years, we get a jellyfish-shaped playground, a fountain plaza, and 270 free events later this Summer. Essentially, it’s the city saying, “Sorry about the viaduct drama, here’s some yoga and a couple of food pop-ups.” Seattle Loves Renters So Much It Won’t Even Let Them Meet: For 18 months, Cathy Moore basically ghosted the Seattle Renters’ Commission. There were no hearings, no appointments, nothing, while she pushed bills that would’ve made it way easier to evict people. Flash forward: she resigns, and just when it looks like the commission might finally get seated, Councilmembers Rob Saka and Sara Nelson pull a classic “Sorry, can’t come, super busy avoiding the duties we were elected to fulfill” move and tank the meeting by skipping it. Meanwhile, renters—many of them volunteers who took time off work—showed up ready to serve their community, only to get hit with silence, shade, and a 404 error from Saka’s office. You can’t make this up. Donnie Chin Honored: Ten years after Donnie Chin was shot and killed while responding to a 911 call, the Chinatown-International District showed up, not just to mourn, but to remember a man who basically did the city’s job for it. Donnie wasn’t just a first responder; he was the first responder, often beating cops and medics to the scene because the system didn’t care enough to show up for his community. And here’s the part that still stings: a decade later, his murder is still unsolved. Your Obligatory Seahawks 411: For the 5 percent of you who actually care and the 15 percent who just want to survive small talk with your partner’s meathhead sibling, here’s your Seahawks update. They just kicked off training camp for their 50th season with a new offensive coordinator, a quarterback best known for seeing “ghosts” mid-game, and the kind of blind optimism usually reserved for football fans and people joining multi-level marketing schemes. Last year, they went 10-7 and still missed the playoffs. But hey, if the defense stays mean, the rookies stay healthy, and the offense stops self-sabotaging, they might just luck their way into the postseason. Death gives Hogan the big boot: I’m a firm believer that you shouldn’t valorize people, simply because their heart stops beating. So, I won’t pretend Hulk Hogan was anything but what he was. He died at 71 from cardiac arrest in Florida, leaving behind a legacy as bloated and performative as pro wrestling itself. Yes, he helped turn wrestling into a pop culture juggernaut, but he also brought us sex tapes, racist rants, and more tall tales than a televangelist on mushrooms—Elvis was a Hulkamaniac? Really? Even in death, Hogan is less a man than a cautionary tale—part myth, part lawsuit, and all-American spectacle, brother. I’ll Leave You With this: someone just randomly texted me that it’s Jennifer Lopez’s birthday. I’m not a fan, so I’m not sure why I needed that information, but apparently she’s completed her 56th lap around the sun. In honor of the occasion, and because LL Cool J is involved, here’s her most tolerable song.",,"['city council', 'municipal', 'budget', 'taxes', 'city council (title)']",11.5,2025-08-03T16:25:54.243338,11210

This year, the Washington Bus and The Stranger's candidate forum was Dungeons & Dragons themed, with drag dungeon mistress Aleksa Manila leading the adventure (with outfit changes, of course!). We learned a lot about the candidates in this year's primary: that Seattle City Council District 2 candidate Adonis Ducksworth might be a Cool Guy Skateboarder, but he's not down to get silly; that D2 candidate Eddie Lin can juggle and walk on his hands; that Katie Wilson used to busk at Pike Place; and that City Attorney Erika Evans always knows the assignment. We also learned just how far D2 candidate Jamie Fackler will go for a bit. He didn't officially make it onstage last night because his campaign hadn't reached the fundraising threshold when event invitations went out, but he still showed up outside dressed as Shrek with a rented donkey and a large bag of onions, and even jumped on stage with City Attorney candidate Rory O'Sullivan (uninvited) to try to hype his performance. In the green room, one candidate said, ""I think we're all processing our Stranger endorsements in these performances."" During the policy section, D2 candidate Jeanie Chunn changed into a stunning green, leafy dress, a shout-out to The Stranger saying she was too ""green"" in our endorsement. We called Wilson's TikToks ""deeply awkward"" (which we stand by), and she said it ""hurt a little bit, but now I feel like I have a reputation to uphold,"" so she decided ""to showcase a talent that's even more deeply awkward."" With less than two weeks to the primary, the candidates showed up, and showed us what they were about. Rinck won best dressed, Evans and Chunn won the most ""inspiration points,"" and Evans won the best overall performance.

In exchange for Dave admitting to the citation, agreeing to pay a $5,000 fine, and attending driving school, the Seattle City Attorney’s Office (CAO) asked the court to waive a 90-day license suspension for Dave. The killing of Kandula garnered international headlines after the body-cam video of Seattle Police Officer and police union Vice President Daniel Auderer cackling at her death became public. The Seattle Police Department has since fired Auderer, and Dave’s discipline for his involvement in Kandula’s death is pending. Auderer has since filed a $20 million lawsuit against the city. At Wednesday’s hearing, Seattle Municipal Court (SMC) Judge Noah Weil accepted the negotiated settlement between the City and Dave, but added a condition for Dave to complete 40 hours of community service. The penalty guidelines for negligent driving allow for a judge to require up to 100 hours of community service, but Weil noted that as a law enforcement officer Dave “does contribute to the community.” “But I do want to recognize the impact this offense has had on the community as well, and so I’m going to require 40 hours of community service,” Weil said. Dave has 30 days to pay his $5,000 fine and about nine months to fulfill the court-ordered conditions of his sentence. Under the agreement with prosecutors, he can avoid a license suspension as long as he commits no new criminal traffic offenses over the next year and complies with all his other sentencing conditions. Dave’s attorney did not immediately return a request for comment. CAO spokesperson Tim Robinson pointed The Stranger to the court records and said the CAO's office handled Dave's case like any other charge of negligent driving in the second degree with a vulnerable person. Robinson is correct that similar charges often result in no license suspension and, in some cases, the CAO may dismiss the ticket, even when a pedestrian’s death is involved. However, Dave’s position as a police officer shielded him from facing more serious charges, as state law permits officers to exceed the speed limit while responding to emergency calls. Earlier this year, the King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office (KCPAO) declined to charge Dave with a felony vehicular homicide in the death of Kandula. Their investigation determined that on January 23, 2023, Dave hit Kandula while traveling at about 63 miles per hour as she crossed in a crosswalk at the intersection of Dexter Avenue North and Thomas Street in South Lake Union. Seconds before Dave saw her crossing, he hit speeds of up to 74 miles per hour in a 25-mile-per-hour zone. Dave attempted to break a second before hitting her. Investigators concluded that had Dave traveled at speeds closer to 50 miles per hour, he could have avoided hitting Kandula. After hitting her, Dave began CPR. The KCPAO found they could not charge Dave as they could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he “consciously” drove with “reckless disregard for the safety of others.” After the KCPAO declined to prosecute, they bounced the case back to the Seattle Police Department, who referred the case to the CAO’s office as a citation. With Dave’s court penalties basically wrapped up, he still awaits a disciplinary decision from SPD connected to the killing of Kandula. In early November, the Office of Police Accountability concluded its investigation into Dave, finding he violated SPD’s policies around driving and not breaking the law, but Interim Chief of Police Sue Rahr has yet to decide on final discipline for Dave. Since Kandula’s death, Publicola has uncovered extensive examples of Dave’s poor driving history and a previous firing from another police department, all of which SPD knew prior to hiring him.",,"['municipal', 'police', 'SPD', 'SPD (title)']",8.0,2025-08-03T16:25:54.242246,3910
https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/06/30/80124841/dems-mamdani-is-not-extreme,The Stranger,"Dems, Mamdani Is Not Extreme Just Can't Get Enough?","At this point, we must conclude that the principal function of ICE isn’t the enforcement of immigration laws, but the occupation and policing of cities. “[We] must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America’s largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside,” Trump posted on TruthSocial, not long after the rain fell, in every way, on his June 14 military parade, and, more significantly, while millions of Americans protested his brazen “will to [authoritarian] power.” Trump then described “Radical Left Democrats” as “sick in the mind,” unpatriotic, and so on and so forth. And then Zohran Mamdani won the Democratic primary in New York City on Tuesday, June 24. He is an immigrant, a socialist, and a Muslim. He is the embodiment of all that is considered wicked in our hyper-MAGA times. The message issued from this stunning victory against America's increasingly and frustratingly milquetoast center-left—a center-left whose leading strategy for Trump’s authoritarianism is to do nothing and let it somehow burn out on its own—is that something must be done. Our values, which are under attack, must be asserted, even if that means imprisonment. It is illegal to kidnap brown (or any kind of) people from the streets or our cities. The US is, and has always been, a multicultural society. This assertion is at the heart of the protests on the streets of LA and the ballots in NYC. But first, we must understand the core of the developments that led us to where we are now. The line in Trump’s June 14 post that requires our attention is found here: “[City people] believe in Open Borders, Transgender for Everybody, and Men playing in Women’s sports.” When you identify cosmopolitan values with lawbreaking, then those values are, in this interpretation, criminal. And so you have crime in the streets, and crime in Pride parades, and crime even in City Hall. On Tuesday, June 17, Brad Lander—New York City’s comptroller, a progressive, and a candidate in the recent NYC primary that saw Andrew Cuomo and the Dems’ conservatives go down in flames—was manhandled and arrested by ICE thugs for doing his job in a court of law. Before that, the thugs did pretty much the same thing to a California senator for legally participating in a Homeland Security press conference. And before that, it was the mayor of Newark, who, again, was doing nothing more than following the law. The appearance of ICE in blue states—blue because they are dominated by their urban centers—doesn’t explain, of course, the essence of this appearance, which has its source in the GOP’s long and steady project of repressing the Black vote. With ICE, voter repression leaves the judiciary apparatus and enters the US’s repressive apparatus, which includes the conventional police (by means of compliance), immigration enforcement, and the army, as demonstrated by the National Guard’s current and ever-expanding occupation of Los Angeles. This occupation, which will eventually expand to all major metropolitan areas, has as its mission the enervation of the blue voters. Why? The GOP, which first lost command of the white vote in cities and, gradually, the suburbs, is in actuality the minority party. Without certain institutional (and therefore structural) advantages, the country should have long accepted the obvious fact of its multiculturalness and been organized by a politics that spanned from the likes of Joe Biden (conservative) to the likes of Mamdani (progressive). Trump would be unelectable if our national democracy were as robustly representative as in states such as California, New York, and, of course, Washington. The urban values supported by the Democratic Party should be regarded as conventional, as the usual, as the everyday. What must be registered as bizarre is not Mamdani, but Stephen Miller. The former actually represents, like the current composition of the Supreme Court, a small segment of America, but is, instead, the expression of a larger political structure that artificially amplifies his voice and views. If the left does not grasp the fact that what is at stake is our lopsided democracy, then we will continue fighting against apparitions (“more should be done to attract MAGA voters,” “Mamdani is a radical,” and so on), but not the real stuff of American life. During his first term in office, Trump continued the GOP’s repression of the Black vote but left urban white voters, who over the past 30 years moved from the graveyard of the right to the spectrum on the left, unbothered. Not so with his second term. He is going after them with the hope of grinding what’s left of American democracy into the dust. This is where ICE comes into the picture. It’s not really about brown people (who, nevertheless, pay the traumatic price of ICE’s brazen lawbreaking); it’s about the white voters who, through urban processes, became liberated not so much from racism (we still have lots of that, even in progressive Seattle) but from the hot, anti-immigrant stuff of Trump’s rallies. Stephen Miller Invokes Racist Conspiracy Theory To Dismiss Mamdani newrepublic.com/post/197219/...[image or embed] And so, this is where things presently stand, Seattle. Los Angeles is coming our way, and it will definitely be a time of trouble, a time when our values are bombarded daily, when America’s white nationalist minority oppresses its multicultural majority. So, how are we going to come? Let’s turn to New York City for an answer.",,"['mayor', 'candidate', 'police']",8.0,2025-08-03T16:25:54.233513,5535

Referrals to Restorative Community Pathways (RCP) are on pause for some juveniles until the prosecuting attorney's office says it sees better results. RELATED | 16-year-old charged as adult in Shoreline shooting that killed 1, injured another It was last year that Jaden Taylor, 16, was charged as an adult in the murder of a Shoreline woman. As KOMO has reported, court documents state that before this tragedy, Taylor had a referral on his juvenile record for allegedly brandishing a weapon at school. The documents allege he was sent to RCP, but he never went. ""[We] see people [in the program] who come back and are accused of really terrible crimes. We want to see that number as low as possible,"" Casey McNerthney of the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office (KCPAO) stated about the diversion program. That same program is meant to keep people ages 17 and younger charged with a first-time felony or misdemeanor from reoffending by connecting them with various community services. The program is back in the spotlight after the prosecutor’s office looked into its success rate, and after a King County councilmember's call for a program audit. LEARN MORE | King County council member seeks audit of youth diversion program after murder case The KCPAO confirms prosecutors will stop juvenile felony diversions, which are non-violent crimes, to the RCP, for now. Juvenile misdemeanor cases are still being referred to the program. ""What we want, and what I think everyone in King County wants, is a transparent program that’s really cost-effective, that shows results of people across the board- and regardless of your political leaning, people look at and say, ‘Yeah, that makes sense to me,'"" McNerthney told KOMO News. Prosecutor Leesa Manion, in a memo, told King County councilmembers the recidivism rate over the past two years was 53%, meaning more than half of the juveniles accused of non-violent felonies in the program were more likely than not to commit another crime. Seattle University Economics Professor Claus Portner analyzed the data for prosecutors and is working on a second analysis he expects to be complete in a few months. A representative with the RCP in a statement argues the sample size used to collect the data is too small to make an analysis, and that the program is a vital initiative that is working. Spokesperson Jasmine Vail adds: ""The support we offer to harmed parties, and the safety and healing we build with young people, isn’t just a smart investment—it’s a pathway to true public safety. These are the lives of young people in our community. We cannot afford to reduce them to flawed numbers."" A Juvenile Detention for Washington State report shows it costs $34,039 annually or $588 per day to house a young person in Washington, whereas community-based programs cost about $75 per day. In late July, Council Member and Budget Chair Rod Dembowski said he does not want the diversion program to be funded through a newly passed Public Safety Sales Tax, despite there being no spending plan. ""I've run amendments to cut the funding for it,"" Dembowski said. ""The prosecutor, frustratingly, has supported that program for years, so I'm glad that she's joined those of us who have had concerns about it."" Manion in the memo noted the county must preserve juvenile diversion as a viable option for case referrals, and that the prosecuting attorney's office ""is committed to working with all King County leaders to continue to build and improve diversion to benefit all our communities."" ""What you’ve got to have is a diversion model that people will agree on, that is transparent and cost-effective and is clearly working,"" McNerthney added. King County’s Department of Human Services holds the contracts for the RCP. The agency did not respond to KOMO's multiple requests for comment about concerns over the diversion program.",,"['councilmember', 'budget', 'public safety']",7.0,2025-08-03T16:27:04.101198,4147
https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/07/16/80151064/thank-science-for-all-the-beach-closures,The Stranger,Thank Science for All the Beach Closures Just Can't Get Enough?,"It’s a Godless 90 degrees. You’ve escaped the inferno of your non-airconditioned apartment and high-tailed it to Madison Beach. The dock is waiting for you to jump off of it into the cool of Lake Washington. You even waited 30 minutes after eating. But there’s a problem: The beach is closed. The water is full of shit. Welcome to hell. All summer, beaches in King County shut down due to bacteria and toxins in the water. The issue isn’t with the water quality in the county’s big lakes as a whole, but with certain shorelines (and a few smaller lakes). The bacteria and toxins fluctuate day to day, which is why, while the county’s maps of closed beaches are looking fairly green right now i.e. clean and safe to swim, in time your favorite beach could be bacteria riddled too. If it seems like there are more beach closures these days than there were when grunge reigned supreme, it’s because there are. And it’s not because the water is getting grodier, or solely because our favorite boogeyman, climate change, is up to his old tricks. It’s science and a cross-departmental collaboration in King County keeping you from swimming a pool of goose shit in blissful ignorance. King County teams are gathering more water samples from swim beaches than they did in the past. Each week, they evaluate the levels of poop bacteria and algae in the water to make the best safety call. So, blame the science if you can’t swim at your favorite lake. Thank the science if you don’t contract e.coli on a swim or your dog doesn’t keel over and die after gulping down that sweet, sweet tainted water. And, it’s not going anywhere thanks to sturdy funding mechanisms that are resilient to autocratic anti-science budget cuts. There’s Something In the Water (Poop) The Cedar River, one of Seattle’s main sources for drinking water, feeds into Lake Washington. So does Issaquah Creek (we do not drink from this). Both fresh water sources are naturally filtered by the intricate root systems of forested land (thanks, trees!). Out in the open water, Lake Washington is fresh and clean. It’s the shores—and smaller lakes around the county—where things get dirty. Daniel Nidzgorski, an ecologist at the King County Department of Natural Resources and Parks, says high levels of bacteria are responsible for most summer beach closures, fancy science talk for poop in the water. ”Poop can carry many different germs that can make people sick,” he says. “And so most of what we're dealing with is goose poop.” It’s a fecal matter frenzy, especially in our waterways after a summer rainstorm washes goose slop into the water. Within all that dookie lurks e.coli, one of bacteria responsible for food poisoning. Poop is mostly bacteria, not what’s left of a meal: 50% to 80% of it is the bacteria that lived in the intestine before nature called. One of the more dangerous intestine-dwellers is e.coli, the culprit behind many a lettuce recall and the reason we wash our hands after going number two. Some strains cause diarrhea and vomiting. When we swim in poop, we can ingest the bacteria. It can also irritate our eyes and skin. A Blue-Green Bacteria Machine Poop is not the only toxin scientists monitor. They’re on the hunt for toxic algae. Cyanobacteria, a photosynthesizing, sunlight gobbling bacteria, makes the blue-green variety of algae. Under certain conditions, the cyanobacteria population explodes, creating algal blooms that kind of look like the inky cloud from a scared octopus. Scientists aren’t totally sure why certain blooms turn toxic, but know it has to do with the cyanobacteria. Nidzgorski says it’s like a switch flips. Algae thrives in excessively warm, nutrient rich lakes. The risk of a toxic cyanobacterial bloom increases when levels of phosphorus and nitrogen are too high. Phosphorus, a key nutrient necessary for life on earth, is everywhere on our little planet. Found naturally in the Earth’s crust, in soil, in the components of our own genetic code, phosphorus seeps into our waterways as things break down: eroded rocks leach phosphorus, decomposing plants and animals leave behind the phosphorus that made life possible. Water picks up traces of it and as it goes through the water cycle (surely you’ve heard of it) falls as phosphorus-rich rain. It becomes a problem when humans disrupt the natural order. Rob Zisette, an aquatic science consultant at Herrera Environmental Consultants, says most lakes receive excess phosphorus through stormwater runoff “Fertilizers, and all the stuff in the watershed that runs off the pavement… gets into the lake,” Zisette says. That includes unscooped dog poop and decomposing leaves. Washington has tried to mitigate our impact. In 2011, the state passed the “Clean Fertilizers, Healthier Lakes and Rivers” bill to limit the amount of phosphorus in commercial fertilizers and household detergents, but phosphorus still infiltrates our waterways. Green Lake’s Phosphorus Problem Zisette’s main focus is Green Lake. The shallow north Seattle lake has a reputation for being unsafe to swim in. The rumor is based in truth. Green Lake is what’s known as a eutrophic lake, which is low in oxygen, but overrich in nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus that propel algae growth, mostly of the blue-green variety that can become toxic. In summer, warm water and sunlight catalyze the bacteria in the phosphorus-rich lake sediment to eat up all the organic matter. Complicated oxygen-cycle science occurs and releases free phosphorus into the water, which acts as fuel for the algae and algal blooms that have plagued the lake since at least 1916. And because of climate change, summers are coming earlier. The county closed Green Lake this June after finding high levels of toxins. Right before we published this piece, the county closed Green Lake’s west beach. All this algae and phosphorus is not unique to Green Lake, but it's certainly a problem. Zisette has been dealing with it since 1991 when grunge really did reign supreme and, much less famously, the city paid for Green Lake’s first “alum” treatment. “Alum” treatments are two part: Acidic aluminum sulfate neutralizes phosphates. The (chemically speaking) basic sodium aluminate prevents the water from turning too acidic. Zisette first dumped a fuck ton into the lake back in the 90s. But not enough. Their calculations were off. It’s a long story, he says. A classic excuse. Then, more than a decade later in 2004, with better calculations and technology, Zisette administered another alum treatment in Green Lake. “We put in a whopper dose, three times that 1991 amount,” Zisette says. Zisette, who (for all of our benefits) keeps putting this shit in the lake, also oversaw the most recent Green Lake alum treatment in 2016. It didn’t go quite as hard. To put it into perspective, the “small treatment” in 2016 used over 81,700 gallons of alum and took six 12-hour days of a boat criss-crossing the lake to complete. It still did the trick. Green Lake turned blue. No matter how much alum Zisette dumps into Green Lake, it’ll always be a temporary fix. They only last about 10 years. Zisette’s research found most of Green Lake’s phosphorus is in its sediment. But rainfall, bird poop, decaying lake plants, and stormwater runoff from Woodland Park and off Aurora Avenue are always adding more. But we don’t know all the ways phosphorus is getting in, Zisette says. That study would take a year and a lot of money to complete. Green Lake is due for another visit with Dr. Alum and nurse sodium aluminate, but it's not in a dire state, Zisette says. Whatever timeline Zisette works out with the city, the treatment itself will likely be smaller due to a thinner city budget. Meanwhile, he’ll still go swimming in Green Lake. Shit Worth Doing Science About Whether it's poop bacteria or the toxic algae in the water, the impact on swimmers is the same, the county says: nausea, cramps, and diarrhea. An A-team of Public Health-Seattle & King County, King County Environmental Lab, King County’s Department of Natural Resources and Parks, and other local jurisdictions don’t want you in the gross, poopy water, so they’re testing all swimming shores weekly. But it’s not like nuclear waste. Or, the devil. “It's not like, ‘Oh my god, I touched the water. I'm gonna die,’ Nidzgorski, who is part of that team, says. “It's just higher than public health thinks is a good trade off.” This testing is new. Seattle only started testing water quality in 1996 after the City Council and Seattle-King County Department of Public Health decided to investigate the poop pollution—yes, human poop—from boats in Lake Washington, says Nidzgorski. That initial program only tackled high-boat traffic areas like Lake Washington. Eventually, testing expanded to give us what we have today. Scientists only started testing for toxic algae in 2005, according to Rachel Gravon, a water quality planner at King County Department of Natural Resources & Parks. It first popped up around Puget Sound in 1989, and the problem grew in the 1990s. In 1997, we had our first dog death. A golden retriever named Maggie died after swimming in Lake Sammamish. Swimming in tainted water is more dangerous for dogs than people. They swallow more as they swim, thus ingesting more toxins. The scummy dip that gives a person a “tummy bug,” as Nidzgorski says, can kill a dog like Maggie (RIP). The Oregon Health Authority actually has dog guidance. Public Health-Seattle & King County doesn’t despite the fact that there are more dogs than children here. Nidzgorski says there’s no guidance because dogs aren’t supposed to swim here. But dogs can’t read, and based on the number of dogs swimming in the lake, neither can many of their owners. “Dogs aren’t supposed to swim in the lake, but they do,” Zisette, the aquatic consultant, says. “And so I worry for dogs, because they drink water that is yucky.” With so many dogs here (and rule breakers likely unaware of the deadly consequences) the county should have a dog scale! Scientists with the swim beach sampling program collect and analyze around 1,600 annually. The science keeps improving. In 2019, county scientists started taking three samples at each beach instead of one. But multiple samples also meant more data. More data increased accuracy. Accuracy resulted in more beach closures. “That doesn't necessarily mean the water quality has changed,” Nidzgorski says. “It's really that we started doing better science.” To test the water at each beach, scientists dunk three bottles for bacteria and one for algae beneath the surface at all sides of a swimming area. Back at the lab, scientists filter the sample for the bacteria, mix them with an agar, and grow them on petri dishes, which become a little colony they can examine under a low power magnifying glass. At a certain temperature, the bad bacteria turns purple. Swim advisories are guidelines, not rules. Scour any open water swim group on Facebook and you’ll find hemming and hawing about whether to swim at a closed beach. Nidzgorski, a scientist, says it’s best to avoid areas with high-bacteria levels and find a safer, clear place to swim at this county website. Or, to be patient. Over the last five years, 16 out of the 28 beaches monitored had low bacteria levels more than 95% of the time, he says. To swim or not to swim is ultimately a personal choice, but the county would rather keep you safe than have you vomiting all over the place and/or killing your dog. Editor's note: This article has been updated since its original publication. We misstated that the county's scientists examine bacterial samples from lake water under a microscope. They, in fact, use a low power magnifying glass.",,"['city council', 'budget', 'parks']",6.0,2025-08-03T16:25:54.230517,11710

Written exclusively by Black Portlanders, the purpose of BlackOut is to remember and reflect on the May 25, 2020 murder of George Floyd at the hands of police, and the 100+ days of protests in Portland that same year. If you're in Portland, you can find BlackOut in print at more than 500 locales citywide, inserted inside the Mercury's Food Issue. You can read all the BlackOut articles here.] ""First, I must confess that over the last few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in the stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Council-er or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate who is more devoted to ‘order’ than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says ‘I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I can't agree with your methods of direct action;’ who paternalistically feels he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by the myth of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait until a ‘more convenient season.’ Shallow understanding from people of goodwill is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection."" -Martin Luther King, “Letter from A Birmingham Jail,” 1963 I’m going to be honest: I’ve always been skeptical about the term ""Black Lives Matter."" Not the intention behind it, but the phrasing. With all due respect to Alicia Garza and Patrisse Cullors, the Black women who gave birth to this term, it has always felt like a rallying cry of “Water is Wet!” or “The Stove is Hot!” or even “Make America Pay Reparations!”—oh wait. “Of course my fucking life matters,” I’ve always thought. No matter what outside forces try to convince the masses, melanin is magic, majestic, ordinary, and ornery. I don’t subscribe to the idea that Black lives are less valuable. We matter. I know it. But for over a decade, this phrase has served as the go-to banner for a movement pushing for our lives to exist fully, without threats, barriers, and degradation. It’s with this knowledge I must acknowledge that every movement transforms, after all. From “I Am a Man” to “Black Lives Matter.” From “In God We Trust” to “Make America Great Again.” On June 5, 2020, the city of Washington, DC, commissioned a mural stretching two city blocks with the simple phrase “BLACK LIVES MATTER” in bold yellow letters. This street painting, located just three minutes from the White House, emerged amid the national outrage sparked by George Floyd’s brutal murder by police less than two weeks earlier. The streets were on fire—some precincts literally were. The pandemic had just forced millions to witness the horror of a man being killed while his brothers in blue stood by. The dots were starting to connect for some: Maybe this wasn’t just a series of isolated incidents. Maybe this was part of a much larger problem. The mural, which became known as Black Lives Matter Plaza, was symbolic. And contrary to the sentiments of some, symbolic gestures do indeed matter. For example, a swastika tells me a lot about a place or person in a very short amount of time. Coincidentally, so do American flags—but that’s another conversation. That line might offend my political connects. But I digress. Black Lives Matter Plaza became a form of protest, but also validation. And while “Black Lives Matter” isn’t my preferred rallying cry, I have to admit it felt good to see it carved out in the concrete. Key word: “felt”—past tense. At the time of writing this, the Trump administration and his allies in Congress began dismantling the mural. The process of destroying it is expected to take between six and eight weeks. They say the mural will be replaced with “more inclusive” works. Republicans are even working on renaming the area, “Liberty Plaza.” Symbols matter. 2020 marked a time when some began reevaluating the symbols that color, and in many ways direct, our lives. Some learned that the Confederacy wasn’t the only entity responsible for enslaving people; presidents of the Union were too. Some learned that slavery wasn’t just a moral issue—it was deeply economic, the backbone of this nation’s growth. Some learned that modern police departments in America evolved from “slave patrols,” whose primary task was capturing runaway enslaved people, who were considered above all, property. As the layers of history were peeled back, many of the symbols around us began to look more like scars than stars. And so the monuments started to fall. Hundreds of statues were dethroned, not by a vote, but by wrath. In my hometown of Portland, Oregon, symbols came tumbling down faster than shit in the Willamette River on a rainy day in the 90’s. George Washington fell. Thomas Jefferson was toppled in front of the once majority Black high school named after him. The 19th century co-owner and publisher of The Oregonian, Harvey Scott, felt the weight of gravity too; replaced by a bronze bust of York—the Black man who helped lead the Oregon Trail alongside Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, only to be returned to slavery at the end of the expedition. (York’s bust was later toppled too.) Grappling with this growing phenomenon of fallen statues, I wrote an article for Street Roots around this time titled “Racist Slurs Permeate Oregon Geography,” in which I detailed how an alarming number of rivers, streams, mountains, and more across my state were originally named after anti-Black slurs like Nigger Ben Mountain and Nigger Brown Canyon – some of which have been renamed since. The point was clear: in order to topple racism, we must do so at both the head and root, for it is in fact embedded throughout the soil of this stolen land. George Floyd, like Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and so many others, are now symbols—a stand-in for any Black life. We understood that what happened to them could happen to any of us at any time in this country. Because it does all the time. Sudden death. Slow death. The system loves to kill, and then throw up a shrine to your murderers. The Burnside Bridge in Portland is one of the many connecting points across the Willamette River, helping the city earn its nickname “Bridgetown.” Named after a white businessman active during the late 1800s, the drawbridge is one of a dozen that have been built across the river since the city was established some 17 decades ago. The bridge is one of the most accessible, whether by bus, car, bike, or foot. It connects the Eastside to downtown Portland, with the iconic Portland sign—featuring a flying deer whose nose glows red at Christmas—marking the entrance. There’s a story about the Ku Klux Klan’s involvement in the bridge’s construction. I don’t have enough ink space for that tangent right now—but do your Googles if you're curious. For me though, the Burnside Bridge had always been little more than a channel from point A to point B. But on June 2, 2020, it became the center of the universe. On that day, thousands of people gathered on the bridge. Estimates say more than 10,000 souls flooded the Burnside. I never watched the video of George Floyd’s final moments. I’d seen enough clips of state violence to know the horror, and I didn’t feel the need to bear witness to his murder either. While I’ve grown tired of these videos, I understand that the social media era I grew up in helped birth the Black Lives Matter movement and other adjacent organizing in my generation. Videos of the dark sides of our lives can go viral at any time, and now oftentimes do. But this time was particularly extraordinary. It was 17-year-old Darnella Frazier’s recording of George Floyd’s murder that gave the world a front row seat to his particularly cruel last moments. It was the existence of her video of his execution, paired with the hollowness of a pandemic that propelled so many millions around the globe to say his name; and thus ours. But for me, I did not need to see to know. I watched the livestream as 10,000 souls stood silently, face down with hands behind their backs for 9 minutes—the exact length of time Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into George Floyd’s neck. And for a moment, watching this scene, I thought maybe, just maybe, a change might come. I was living in an apartment in Old Town at the time, just blocks from where the scene was unfurling. I didn’t feel compelled to add my body to the mass that day. Not for any one reason, but for that moment, I felt like I was right there. I was proud. Dare I say, I was starting to feel some hope. The protests that followed George Floyd’s death were the largest in U.S. history. They weren’t confined to cities—they spread to suburbs, rural areas, and eventually to the world. From Portland to Poland, people joined the movement for Black lives, creating millions of new co-conspirators from all backgrounds. For a while, I wondered if the world was finally catching up to the way we’ve been catching hell. Could it be that America was beginning to “get it”? But 100+ days later, the protests gave way to distraction. Infighting, fatigue, and the usual tactics used by three letter agencies to dismantle Black liberation movements began to crystallize their grip. My pessimism was reignited. It’s not that the protests didn’t accomplish anything—they did. To suggest otherwise gives over-inflated credit to white mediocrity. We marched and learned. We shared stories and space. We cried, we gave. We pushed back. We reclaimed shit that’s been ours. That perfect storm, we rode it ‘til the wheels fell off. It’s 2025 now, and the storm has indeed passed. But the reality hasn’t. When would another moment like this come again? One where a viral pandemic sat the entire world down for months to show us our collective frailty? One where that same pandemic is paired with the death of a Black man in such a horrific way, that it compels millions to risk their health and very bodies in the midst of a global emergency, because finally we collectively understood that the emergency for Black people had been viral long before COVID-19. It won’t. It won’t ever happen again. IT WON’T! However, Black people will continue to die. In the five years since George Floyd, many more have, whether directly at the hands of the state or more covertly through systemic forces. Despite this, Black resistance persists. From Pan-Africans to the Panthers, the Urban League to the NAACP, seasoned activists to the next baton-carriers birthed out this leg of the Black Lives Matter movement; resistance remains varied but persistent. I too, persist. I wake up every day and do what I do; I protest. I write. I organize. I make art. I connect. I strategize. I tell the stories of our greatness. I raise two little girls to be conscious of the world they’re coming up in, giving them the a little bit more truth with every milestone, so that they do in fact understand that water is wet, the stove is hot, and that America should pay reparations. But I cannot yet tell them what world they will inherit. One of the most striking quotes from Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. is, “the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice.” I first heard these words, revived by Rev. Dr. Leroy Haynes Jr., while covering a rally against police violence across the street from Portland City Hall as a reporter more than a decade ago. They always stuck with me. The older I get now though— especially since 2020—I fear those words were just pretty prose. The words King subsequently spoke towards the closing chapter of his life resonate more strongly these days: “I fear I may have integrated my people into a burning house.” Quote that at your next MLK Day get-together. As the common symbol of the Civil Rights movement and the de-facto figurehead for American progress, King’s words now feel more relevant than ever. Liberals love to blame Trump and the Republicans for the flames, but there are plenty on the other “side” who have forgotten the Burnside Bridge. There are many who have since seen the Burnside Bridge in 2020 and decided it would make for good art, a nice social media post, and “powerful” conversation, but continuous action was a step or two too far today. For many it seems George Floyd’s face is more like a Nirvana t-shirt today. The system is flawed, but not that bad. That’s the problem with symbols. Symbols should inspire, but they shouldn’t and can never replace action. The erasure of Black Lives Matter Plaza in D.C. doesn’t stop the work I do, but it is a reminder of the times we’re in. It's a reminder of how quickly some have sprinted from 2020, into “moderation.” A reminder that like unapologetically progressive (and absurdly accomplished) Commissioner Jo Ann Hardesty’s replacement by law-and-order conservative Rene Gonzalez (who was mostly absurd) on Portland City Council; Just like Oregon Democrats and Republicans teaming up to roll back Measure 110 and recriminalize addiction; Just like Intisar Abioto raising a million dollars to reclaim the house of the Portland NAACP founder only to be undercut by a White Realtor and White buyers, And like the 2020 protests being reduced into “discourse” of “riots” that we must “clean up” after—America is back to its regularly scheduled programming. And the fire is burning. Five years later, George Floyd is no longer just a man. He’s a symbol—a reminder of America’s blood on the roots, and the leaves. I know what I see when I see George Floyd. What about you? Five years later, it feels like it did six years ago. Five years later, we’ve returned to “normal.” And now, perhaps, the fire is burning hotter than ever. So, when I’m gray-haired (God willing), driving across the Burnside Bridge with Black Lives Matter fading in the rearview, I wonder: Will I be crossing into the ashes or a new beginning? Only time will tell. Maybe all that “care” was just… symbolic. Donovan Scribes is an award-winning writer, producer, and owner of the communications consulting firm D Scribes LLC.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/05/07/80045377/uw-cries-antisemitism-in-wake-of-pro-palestine-protest,The Stranger,UW Cries Antisemitism in Wake of Pro-Palestine Protest Just Can't Get Enough?,"On Monday, right before 5pm, dozens of masked people, several of whom were students, flocked to the University of Washington’s new Interdisciplinary Engineering Building (IEB). One group walked into the main entrance. Another group trotted down the stairs leading to the ground floor entrance. More went around the back. Vans and cars pulled up on E Stevens Way NE, stopped momentarily, and deposited more people and supplies such as bisected garbage cans-turned-shield and large metal sheets. Inside the 700,000-square-foot building’s glass walls, the new arrivals asked students and faculty to leave because they were taking over the building. As they left, informational flyers in hand, the protesters began to chain the IEB’s doors shut. The IEB cost UW $102 million. Ten million of that came from Boeing. For a century, Boeing has been one of UW’s top donors and the top employer of school alumni. In an April 2022 collaboration proposal between UW and Boeing, UW says that they will “work in close partnership with subject experts at Boeing to make sure the curriculum and research topics are highly relevant for top-priority challenges within the company.” And since 1948, Boeing has also been a key arms supplier to the Israel Defense Forces. The university’s relationship with Boeing is why these people had come to the IEB. For several hours on Monday, protesters affiliated with the Students United for Palestinian Equality and Return (SUPER) UW took over the IEB. They hung a sign renaming it the Sha’ban al-Dalou Building, honoring a Palestinian teenager slain by Israeli forces. In a press release, SUPER UW said they were “responding to the call” of the student movement in Gaza following the October 7 attacks in Israel, celebrating the way it “shattered the illusion of zionist-imperialist domination and brought Palestine to the forefront for all justice-loving people of the world.”“Our brothers and sisters in Gaza are living under a sky of constant US-funded rocket fire, while the zionist regime is continuing its land thefts and the torture and imprisonment of over 10,000 Palestinians who are facing lengthy sentences and unspeakable abuse,” the press release read. “Meanwhile, American and western institutions, like UW, continue to fund these atrocities and attempt to demonize the just struggle of the Palestinian people.” UW reported the protesters caused $1 million in damages, saying protesters spray painted messages like “Boeing Kills” on the walls, ripped a classroom door off its hinges, sealed doorways with epoxy glue, and smashed the glass doors housing specialized machinery that cost upwards of $100,000 a piece. (When reached for comment, Noah Weight, a student in SUPER UW, didn’t comment on the reported damage. Instead, he pointed to the group's mission. “Every single university [in Gaza] has been reduced to rubble,” Weight wrote, “but Western journalists, academics, and the public seem more concerned with damage done here, to a building that is intended to expand the scale of that destruction,” Weight wrote.) Late into Monday night, police in riot gear gathered. They faced off with protesters, and together with University of Washington Police, the Seattle Police Department arrested 32 protesters on Monday night for criminal trespass in the first degree, a misdemeanor. This marked the first significant pro-Palestine on-campus demonstration since Donald Trump took office and began targeting, detaining, and deporting international students involved in last spring’s protest encampments. Thanks to this administration, the landscape for protesting in general, and especially protesting against the war in Gaza, has changed. And our local responses show diverging paths: those who parrot the Trump administration’s propaganda, and those who resist it. This morning, Washington Attorney General Nick Brown released a statement about the damage to the school. He called the protest “disturbing,” and said that “it is clear that there was substantial damage to public property and threats to the overall safety of the university community.” He continued: “I am thankful that those responsible were arrested and, if found guilty, should be held accountable. I fully and always support people’s right to protest and to express their views. Indeed it is foundational to our democracy. But everyone has a right to be safe on campus and UW must enforce the law.” This is the kind of standard law and order statement you can expect from the powers that be when protests go down—especially when there's property damage in the mix. The university struck a different tone. After Monday’s building occupation, UW President Ana Mari Cauce sent an email to the UW community where she condemned the protest and said the university would “continue our actions to oppose antisemitism, racism and all forms of biases.” The official UW statement on the matter from UW spokesperson Victor Balta called the protest an “antisemitic statement” and said UW “will not be intimidated by this sort of offensive and destructive behavior and will continue to oppose antisemitism in all its forms.” Yesterday, in a press release, Trump’s Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism, a collaboration of some of the biggest idiots in our government (an Avengers assembly from hell of the Department of Education, Department of Health, and General Services Administration) weighed in on the situation, using their same tired rhetoric. U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon called the protest “yet another horrifying display of the antisemitic harassment and lawlessness which has characterized many of our nation’s elite campuses over the last several years,” and said it disrupted the lives of “Jewish students who live in fear on campus, of their equal opportunity protections and civil rights.” But the administration had a surprise for UW. Seattle is generally the Big Bad Radical Left in the Trump administration’s commentary, but yesterday, they broke that streak. The task force specifically commended UW’s “strong statement condemning [Monday] night’s violence.” Under a Trump administration that is already withholding research grant money, threatening funding over diversity and inclusion policies, and directly attacking universities like Harvard and Columbia, where prominent protests were held, the tenor of the University of Washington’s reaction to these protests has shifted. Echoing Trump administration talking points, faculty and administrators lambasted Monday’s demonstration as antisemitic. Last spring, when a pro-Palestine tent encampment sprung up in UW’s quad, UW’s tone was different. For three weeks, students and non-students gathered and refused to leave until the university cut ties with Israel and Boeing. It ended after UW agreed to increase transparency about its financial holdings and provide scholarships for displaced Palestinian students among other things. In her statement regarding the encampments, Cauce only referenced “vile rhetoric.” Now, “vile rhetoric” has become clear, actionable “antisemitism.” Alex Stonehill, the associate director of communication leadership at UW, rebuked the claims of antisemitism in these protests. “[Universities] are supposed to be these bastions of critical thought and critical inquiry about what’s happening,” Stonehill said. “When we see pretty baseless accusations of antisemitism on campus and when we don’t interrogate that and push back against it and try to figure out what’s actually happening, we’ve given up. It’s important to take a stand.” Student protesters such as Eric Horford believe in their movement, regardless of the higher stakes under the current administration. “We know the Trump administration is incredibly repressive,” Horford said. “But ultimately, regardless of whether it was Trump or Biden and Harris in office, the federal government has been incredibly anti-Palestinian and anti-student movement. The repression is always strong, and that's why we remain optimistic that no matter who we're up against, that our movement can stay strong and grow.” “We are demanding that Boeing and the influence of other companies that profit off of war be removed from our educational spaces here at UW,” Horford said. “We think it is shameful that after the developments of last year, they would continue and finish the construction of a building that's been invested in by Boeing.” But the situation is different for UW these days. They may not be as willing to appease protesters when they are busy appeasing a dictator. In the last month, the Trump administration has escalated its throwdown with the university system, specifically calling out the pro-Palestinian protests and anti-semitic, and calling on universities to quash them. In a letter sent to Harvard by the same clown brigade that ordered a review of UW, the administration claimed that “Harvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that justify federal investment.” And among other things, they demanded that the school report “individual faculty members who discriminated against Jewish or Israeli students or incited students to violate Harvard’s rules following October 7, and the University and federal government will cooperate to determine appropriate sanctions for those faculty members within the bounds of academic freedom and the First Amendment.” The letter lists the ways Harvard can get on its knees and win its federal funding back. When Harvard refused, Trump threatened not only its federal funding, but its tax-exempt status. And just yesterday, Columbia University announced layoffs of nearly 180 people after Trump cut $400 million of federal grant funding from the university, claiming that it “repeatedly fails to protect students from anti-Semitic harassment on campus.” UW would struggle to survive a similar attack. Funding has never been more tenuous for the university. It received around $2.1 billion in federal funds for research in 2024. To make matters financially worse, the proposed state budget trims state funds allocated to UW by over $166 million. And this has been piled on top of an already struggling university budget. Back during the 2008 recession, the state cut UW’s per-student funding by half. The funding has yet to recover to where it was before 2008. According to UW Magazine, the state funded UW the same amount in 2019 as it did in 1990. Can a cash-strapped university still stay true to its values under the Trump administration? Universities have the potential to be an essential tool in standing up to dictators. UW prides itself on “being boundless,” except maybe boundlessness is limited by who holds the capital. In the 15 years Stonehill has worked at UW, he’s seen the public service mission eroded due to the loss of federal and state funding. “The university had to move more towards corporate funding and wealthy philanthropists to make things happen here,” Stonehill said. “What we're seeing now is the downside of that. Corporations like Boeing are making weapons that are being used to kill people, and we can't say anything about it because we’re reliant on their money. I’d really like for that to change.” Editor’s Note: This story has been updated to reflect new documentation that shows a collaboration proposal between Boeing and the University of Washington.

https://komonews.com/news/local/bellevue-school-district-selling-10-acre-parcel-to-help-with-budget-crisis,KOMO News,Current Weather Game Center Bellevue School District selling 10-acre land parcel to help with budget crisis,"Cloudy 61 71 58 Today 71 58 Monday 74 58 Tuesday 74 61 Latest Weathercast Now 61 Mon 74 Tue 74 by Jackie Kent, KOMO News Reporter TOPICS: The Bellevue School District is selling off a chunk of land to a home builder to help fix its budget crisis. The undeveloped land in the Westwood Highlands neighborhood, where not everyone is on board with the $30 million plan to build single-family homes. RELATED | Bellevue School District faces state oversight over budget shortfall, depleted reserves Following the district board sign-off on Thursday, Bellevue schools are entering into an agreement to sell off the wooded property to Tri Pointe Homes. School officials at the district board meeting explained that the more than 10-acre parcel is no longer needed and is unfit for developing a school, while the superintendent said this deal is going to accelerate the district's path to financial recovery. ""We have other properties at our disposal if we should, in the future, need to engage in the construction of another elementary school,"" BSD Chief Operating Officer Dr. Heather Sanchez explained. The $30 million proceeds will speed up the district’s new financial recovery plan by restoring the general fund reserve. The district has been under binding financial conditions with the state since July as it faces a budget crisis due to dropping enrollment, a loss of state funding, and boosted operating costs. ""Part of the reason it comes down to selling the property is not just to spend on our regular costs, but it’s also to make sure we have a reserve, which we have depleted, in order for us to come out of binding conditions,"" added Board Member Jane Aras. ""That has to happen first."" A new state law allows any Washington school district under those conditions to add the profits from a one-time sale to the district's general fund instead of the capital budget used for building projects and technology. However, not everyone is on board. One Bellevue neighbor off camera pointed out that 139th Ave. SE is the only inlet to that property. He worries that having any development could create traffic back-up on his street. Board Member Monica Webster said while the development's impacts on the neighborhood are still unclear, the school district will be responsive to people's concerns. ""The district does plan to stay attentive to any potential adjustments that might be necessary at those surrounding schools in that area if there is a need for that,"" Webster stated. The school district hopes to close the sale before Spring 2027. Also starting next year, another new state law - HB 2049 - allows the district to increase the local levy collection by $500 per student. That amounts to about $5 million for the coming school year and is expected to generate $10 million every year after that. The superintendent said this deal, combined with the local levy, will help BSD restore its budget in two to three years instead of the seven to 10 they had anticipated. People will be able to weigh in when the district has a public hearing on the budget on Aug. 21.",,"['budget', 'development', 'budget (title)']",4.0,2025-08-03T16:27:04.101198,3072

Jordyn Weichert, 35, has been identified as the suspect in an August 3 release by King County prosecutors. PREVIOUS COVERAGE | Man killed in stabbing, second person found dead on bus a block away The victim, identified as Ramon Aragon-Garcia, 55, was found around 6:20 p.m. on July 14, in the SODO neighborhood. A distressed man waved down King County deputies in the area for an unrelated call, telling them that his friend had been murdered in a white van. Upon entering the van, they found the body of Aragon-Garcia and a knife. According to court documents compiled during the investigation, Weichert was seen entering Ramon Aragon-Garcia's van on the evening of the 14th. Witnesses reported hearing a male voice say ""stop it"" from inside the van, and surveillance footage captured Weichert leaving the van with what appeared to be blood on her chest. The documents state that surrounding video surveillance cameras at very locations showed no one but Weichert entering and leaving the van during the estimated time before the discovery of the body. The Seattle Police Department's investigation revealed that Aragon-Garcia suffered multiple stab wounds, including to his head, face, arms, and a fatal injury to his femoral artery. The medical examiner classified the death as a homicide. Court documents note that prior to the killing, Weichert and Aragon-Garcia were known to each other and seemed to be friendly. SEE ALSO | Person of interest wanted after man found stabbed to death in van in SODO After several days spent trying to track down Weichert, including with the help of civilian tips, law enforcement arrested her on July 29. She is being held $5 million bail, and the state has requested electronic home detention with GPS tracking if she posts bail, citing concerns for community safety and the likelihood of future violence. Notably, court documents state that she has three prior convictions for vehicular homicide and two convictions for vehicular assault, all stemming from one incident. Washington state has a ""three strikes law,"" which mandates life imprisonment without parole for people convicted of three ""most serious offenses,"" which include Class A felonies. The law is meant to protect public safety by incapacitating habitual violent offenders. Vehicular homicide counts as a class A felony, which Weichert has 3 convictions of. However, the King County Prosecuting Attorney Office noted that ""convictions stemming from the same incident are not counted as separate strikes under Washington law,"" meaning that despite having 3 Class A convictions, she would only incur one ""strike"" in the system.",,"['public safety', 'police']",4.0,2025-08-03T16:27:04.102198,2889

Richardson was arrested Sunday on a fourth degree domestic violence offense, according to the police report obtained by The Associated Press. On Thursday, she ran in the opening round the women's 100 meters at U.S. track and field championships in Eugene, Oregon. She has an automatic bye to the world championships in September in Tokyo as the defending champion. The 25-year-old Richardson was booked into the South Correctional Entity (SCORE) in Des Moines, Washington, at 6:54 p.m. last Sunday and released Monday at 1:13 p.m. “USATF is aware of the reports and is not commenting on this matter,” USA Track and Field said in a statement. Richardson's agent did not immediately reply to an email request for comment. The police report said an officer at the airport was notified by a Transportation Security Administration supervisor of a disturbance between Richardson and her boyfriend, sprinter Christian Coleman. The officer reviewed camera footage and observed Richardson reach out with her left arm and grab Coleman's backpack and yank it away. Richardson then appeared to get in Coleman's way with Coleman trying to step around her. Coleman was shoved into a wall. The report later said that Richardson appeared to throw an item at Coleman, which the TSA indicated may have been headphones. In the police report, the officer said: “I was told Coleman did not want to participate any further in the investigation and declined to be a victim.” Richardson won the 100 at the 2023 world championships in Budapest and finished with the silver at the Paris Games last summer. She also helped the 4x100 relay to an Olympic gold. She had a positive positive marijuana test at the 2021 U.S. Olympic trials and didn't compete at the Tokyo Olympics.",,"['transportation', 'police']",4.0,2025-08-03T16:27:04.099198,2056

The fire, which is human-caused, continues to burn in steep and rugged terrain, posing challenges for firefighting efforts. PREVIOUSLY | Level 3 evacuation orders issued for Bear Gulch fire burning in Mason County Increased humidity has helped moderate the fire's growth, but firefighters remain engaged in both day and night operations to protect structures and other critical values at risk. The fire has crossed Copper Creek, and crews are using sprinkler systems around cabins and structures while removing flammable materials to reduce fire potential. Efforts are underway to enhance road systems east of the fire to make them more defensible, and crews are identifying natural features northwest of the fire to halt its northward progression. Drones are being used for reconnaissance and to strategically apply fire to remove fuels from the advancing main fire. On the southern portion of Lake Cushman, crews are accessing remote sections by boat to protect structures, timber, and power infrastructure. Five helicopters are supporting these operations. The fire is expected to persist in the Daniel J. Evans and Mount Skokomish Wilderness areas until extinguished by fall rains and snow. Weather conditions remain warm and dry, with light winds and moderate humidity recovery. Cooler conditions and light showers are anticipated late next week. Lake Cushman has been closed to public use in support of suppression and evacuation efforts. Campfires are prohibited in Olympic National Forest and Olympic National Park, and all outdoor burning is banned in Mason County. Numerous road, trail, and campground closures are in effect for public safety. Detailed information on Olympic National Forest closures can be found HERE. Evacuation orders are in place, with the Bear Gulch Fire area near Dry Creek Trail under a Level 3 ""GO"" evacuation, including the Staircase Campground. Areas south of Dry Creek are under a Level 2 ""BE SET"" notice. A Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the fire area. Officials urge the public to avoid flying drones near the fire, as this grounds firefighting aircraft. The Olympic National Forest is seeking public assistance in investigating the fire's origin.

And I, like you, and your cat, hate the Blue Angels, hate the sky-ripping rocket-racket. But we are in a military empire. To pretend otherwise, I still believe, is to prefer the illusion to the reality. I have said this before (two years ago to be exact), and it deserves repeating because, despite all that’s going on with Trump, nothing about the US has fundamentally changed. And I say this as a person who voted for Kamala Harris, and would vote for her again and again. Getting rid of the Blue Angels will only hide the fact that our society is a military empire. There is a good reason why the US's defense spending is still, by far, the largest in the world. This is not simply a waste of money (though that reading, which has its intellectual birth in The Grundrisse and is developed by Rosa Luxemburg. has economic value and cannot be easily dismissed). But it's the raw power to hurt and kill that makes the excessive (even obscene) consumption Americans enjoy possible: cheap goods at Walmart and Amazon, access to the resources needed to lock consumers into automobile debt, and way too low prices at the pump (even in Washington State). In the same way we should not sweep the homeless from the streets (putting aside the humanitarian argument for it, of course), we should not scrub the Blue Angels from our skies. The suffering our rich society deliberately throws onto its streets does not go away when it's swept out of sight. And yet, this is what many left-leaning voters want: the consequences of the unreal inflation of housing prices, the absence of anything close to meaningful social housing, and the rejection of rent controls made invisible. The removal of the Blue Angels will only increase the size of Seattle's famous liberal bubble. But it will not in any way impact American militarism. We will have peaceful skies in early August while we are still in the heart of the empire, still supporting the armed forces in Saudi Arabia, Israel, Turkey, Egypt, El Salvador, and elsewhere. Submarines with nuclear weapons will still be a ferry ride away from downtown. The last thing we should have is a mind whose sky is eternally clear of the Blue Angels and the Navy that supports this spectacle. When you are putting gas into your car and the sudden roar of the jets shatters your nerves, do not separate what you are doing from what just flew over you. The latter makes the former possible. The sequence is ideology in a state of perfection, which means: It's actually telling the truth. This is how the system functions. This is the empire as it is: the baseball park in Seattle, the army base in Tacoma; the cruise ships on the Sound, the nuclear submarines beneath the Sound; homes on San Juan Islands, the battleships serviced in Everett. A weaker ideology (and there is no such thing as no ideology) results from a sky without the Blue Angels. We may or may not like the truth of their noise and the empire they represent and impose, but this is where you live, this is how you eat, and this is the traffic jam you often find yourself in. And hating Trump, as most in Seattle do, doesn't change this fact. In the way change is not likely if we do not see the homeless, change is not likely if we do not see that our form of consumption is not outside but very much inside of the empire.",,"['housing', 'homeless']",4.0,2025-08-03T16:25:54.236257,3446
https://www.thestranger.com/queer/2024/12/16/79827634/the-first-trans-rights-case-of-the-next-trump-era,The Stranger,The First Trans Rights Case of the Next Trump Era Just Can't Get Enough?,"There is a widespread political fantasy that transgender people are so central to American life that they swayed the outcome of a US Presidential election and turned millions into authoritarian apologists. The most obsessive rightwingers believe trans people control American universities, corporations and language itself, justifying the more than 1,000 bills to restrict trans health care and civil rights as retribution for an imagined social hijacking. Earlier this month, one of those bills from Tennessee, SB1, came before the Supreme Court. And next June, the Justices will determine whether the law violates the 14th Amendment’s Equal Protection clause. US v. Skrmetti is the first case before the court to directly consider this question for trans youth, but it's not as straightforward as determining if this law discriminates against them. SB1, passed in March 2023, prohibits doctors from prescribing trans children puberty blockers, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), or gender-affirming surgery, while allowing those same treatments for intersex children, children starting puberty early or late, and medical conditions other than gender dysphoria. The state argued it had a compelling interest in “encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, particularly as they undergo puberty.” The petitioners—trans children, their parents, their doctors, the American Civil Liberties Union and the federal government—contend transgender people fall into a quasi-suspect class. They allege the state ignored the proven benefits of gender-affirming care and that the law itself is making a distinction on the basis of those who “appreciate” and disdain their sex. A lower district court sided with them, and granted a preliminary injunction temporarily preventing the law from taking effect. The conservative Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision, and an appeal brought the case before the court last Wednesday. The most important question the Justices must answer is what the “standard of review” should be in this case, a legal term for how skeptical courts should be when evaluating laws that treat and classify groups differently. Tennessee draws the line between kids who take hormones and puberty blockers to treat gender dysphoria and those prescribed the same drugs for reasons including early puberty and intersex conditions. Imara Jones, creator of the nonprofit multimedia publication Translash, was in the courtroom last Wednesday. Not one to sugarcoat, she still emerged hopeful. “Every time they tested various arguments, they quickly realized they were in a cul-de-sac that always brought them back to sex,” she says. “And I think it reinforced the main argument from the Solicitor General and ACLU.” Choosing the Arena Courts evaluate Equal Protection cases on three levels of judicial scrutiny: “Suspect,” or strict scrutiny for cases involving race, religion, national origin, and lack of citizenship, “quasi-suspect” or middle-tier scrutiny in gender and sex-based cases, and “rational basis” or minimum scrutiny, when no “suspect” class applies. The higher the level of scrutiny, the more a government must do to prove its law is both necessary and in the interest of the state. Conversely, under “rational basis” review, a state just needs to prove the government’s action is rationally related to a legitimate interest. That’s the reason this question of “tier” matters. Under heightened scrutiny, Tennessee has more to prove, and their body of evidence is lacking. Tennessee argues SB1 does not make a sex classification; instead, they argue, they’re making an age distinction unrelated to sex. Earlier this month, Justice Samuel Alito seemed swayed by this argument, recalling his statements in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the 2022 case that overturned Roe v. Wade, and the 1974 case, Geduldig v. Aiello, which found that states could regulate medical procedures related to biological sex. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, the official who represents the federal government before the Supreme Court, held that while those cases only implicated sex, Tennessee’s law made explicit distinctions. “That doesn’t apply in any relevant respect here,” she said. “These aren’t drugs that are limited to one sex or another. Both males and females alike have been prescribed puberty blockers, hormones, testosterone, estrogen. They produce the same physical characteristics … no matter if your sex is male or female.” Elana Redfield is a Federal Policy Director at the Williams Institute, a LGBTQ public-policy research center at the University of California, Los Angeles. She says Prelogar’s point could potentially resonate with Justice Neil Gorsuch. But it’s hard to know for sure. The normally chatty justice didn’t ask a single question during oral arguments. There’s hope for a repeat of the unexpected 5-4 decision in Bostock v. Clayton County, the first and only Supreme Court case to consider transgender rights, where Gorsuch sided with the liberals and authored a majority opinion about employment discrimination that grounded trans-friendly policy in Joe Biden’s federal agencies. “An individual’s homosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to employment decisions,” he wrote. “That’s because it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.” However, Bostock can’t be treated as a bellwether: Skrmetti is not a Title VII case; The court that delivered the narrow ruling on employment discrimination is a shade redder than it was in 2019; And Gorsuch has not tucked a trans flag under his robes. In Bostock, Gorsuch addressed employers worried the court’s decision would sweep “beyond Title VII to other federal or state laws that prohibit sex discrimination,” including sex-segregated bathrooms, locker rooms and dress codes. “But none of those other laws are before us today,” he wrote. That limited ruling frees Gorsuch and the rest of the conservative bench to rule differently here. Whatever Gorsuch comes to will be rigid and textualist. While his logic in past cases would suggest applying heightened scrutiny, there’s no evidence he is sympathetic to the petitioners. Meanwhile, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed the unlikely possibility of creating a new suspect class for trans people, but said to her knowledge, before the laws of the last three years, and Trump’s military ban during his first term, there was no history of discrimination under government-enacted laws. But modern concepts of transness do not always apply to a historical framework. Chase Strangio, a staff attorney at the ACLU and the first trans person to argue before the Supreme Court, mentioned a history of laws forbidding cross dressing, and a number of old statutes that lumped gay and trans people together. Even recent historical figures from early in the gay rights movement we’d think of as transgender today wouldn’t have described themselves as such. Even if the evidence of de jure discrimination convinces Barrett, a new suspect class has not been named in decades. It’s unlikely she’d rule in favor of creating it. The 1 Percent D Dangaran, a board member of the National Trans Bar Association, has faith that the court will apply intermediate scrutiny in this case, but worries the conservative Justices will throw their weight behind the argument that gender-affirming care harms people who later detransition, which Justice Kavanugh didn’t think the court could ignore. Children and adults who seek trans healthcare want trans healthcare, and study after study shows it improves their general well-being. For this reason, few change their minds. However, detransition is a real, and deeply personal experience the right misrepresents as a singular political argument against trans healthcare. While a small percentage of people detransition because they regret taking hormones or undergoing surgery, many stop transitioning because they lack social support, simply experience a shift in their self-conception, or are pausing before re-transitioning later. The right—and a minority of vocal detrans people who claim to speak for the community—have worked to draw a false equivalence between their experiences and the experiences of many more people who benefit from trans care (gender-affirming surgeries, for example, have extremely low regret rates of about 1%.) Republicans have not scrambled to ban similar procedures such as elective, risk-reducing mastectomies for cis people, although regret rates are five to 14 times higher, or breast augmentations, which between 5% and 9% of patients regret, according to a literature review in the peer-reviewed American Journal of Surgery. The same study found regret rates for body contouring dance between 10% and 33%. Other studies show up to 30% of patients regret knee surgeries and prostatectomies. About 19% of people regret bariatric surgery for weight loss. But here we are: Supreme Court justices and the journalists sculpting their views are circling the wagons over a 1% regret rate. Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti has gone as far to say that the medical consensus on gender affirming care is “fake.” None of them are doctors, so it’s not surprising they’d take medical information out of context. Anti-trans bills reinforce this bias by making it easier for former patients to sue doctors who provided gender-affirming care. What is it about this small risk that induces the urge to slam the brakes on medical care that works for the vast majority of people who receive it? The news media seem to see the narratives around abortion regret, a real experience, as the anti-abortion propaganda that it is. Mainstream news organizations are not devoting limited resources to investigate how those experiences might inform the legitimacy of a procedure that has medical consensus. But many do spend an unusual amount of time and effort questioning gender-affirming care. The specter of gender regret haunts differently. Ironically, the focus suggests living in a body intolerably marred by gendered characteristics is a unique horror. The very thing gender-affirming care seeks to remedy. “When the facts are truly weighed, that should not be an exceedingly persuasive justification for this broad categorical ban that covers both those who want it, and that small percentage of people who may actually feel harmed by the care they receive,” Dangaran said. Similarly, Tennessee is relying on bunk scientific claims to discredit gender affirming care that would crumple under examination. Totally circumventing questions about suspect classes and equal protection, Kavanaugh argued that it’s not the court’s job to evaluate the evidence or resolve medical and policy questions. (As Strangio pointed out, the court didn’t hesitate to apply heightened scrutiny in a case involving medical judgements when it ruled churches’s right to freely practice religion superseded the public health risk of spreading COVID-19 at large gatherings.) The Swing(ish) Votes Justices Alito, Clarence Thomas, Kavanaugh, and Chief Justice John Roberts seemed most sympathetic to Tennessee's arguments, while questions from Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson indicated they saw the connection between the precedent established in Bostock, and the dangerous precedent the court could set in this case. Brown Jackson noted a parallel to the “scientific” arguments made in Loving v. Virginia, in which the court evaluated if Virginia’s “anti-miscegenation” laws banning interracial marriage had any rational basis. If the court approaches this case by saying “there are lots of good reasons for this policy and who are we as the Court to say otherwise,” Jackson said, “I'm worried that we're undermining the foundations of some of our bedrock equal protection cases.” Barrett and Gorsuch are the wildcards, and only one has to side with the conservatives for majority. This could come down to an ideological decision that sides with the state over the precedent of sex discrimination and what many would see as an objective reading of the Constitution. The court could conservatively kick it back to the lower court, or determine the reasoning in Bostock applies. That would be strong support for liberal interpretations of Section 1557, the Affordable Care Act’s anti-discrimination statute, cases on sports and other cases on gender-affirming care. Those cases are coming. A victory for the petitioners in this case would be narrow at best, and nobody should expect Obergefell, when people married hours after the decision ran down the courthouse steps. These laws are scattershot across the country, with different technicalities built into each one. Twenty-six states have restricted gender-affirming care for minors. While most are roughly similar to Tennessee, and this case has the potential to invalidate them, there are other ways of limiting care, like cutting funding and increasing liability. On the other hand, the petitioners did not take up a number of other related legal claims, including a parent’s right to choose the best care for their child and first amendment claims.

https://www.thestranger.com/mountain-dispatch/2024/12/11/79820309/the-abortion-haven-in-the-mountain-west,The Stranger,The Abortion Haven in the Mountain West Just Can't Get Enough?,"What if I told you there’s an island of abortion rights in the Mountain West, born of a state constitution so forward-looking that it started out by enshrining abortion rights a full year before the US Supreme Court’s landmark abortion decision Roe V. Wade in 1973? Hey from Montana, a strange, gigantic state that people have all kinds of ideas about. When I travel, which is often, telling someone I’m from Montana typically elicits one of two responses: The first is, “Oh, Trump Country!” I’ve had this one blurted at me from Mongolia to Michigan, no matter that Montana barely has a million people and almost no say in presidential electoral politics. The second tends along the lines of, “Oh I’m obsessed with Montana and I want to move there/vacation there/buy a fourth home there.” Okay. What I’ve never heard in response is anything about the strange political nuances of this place, or its wild history. Yes, my home state is admittedly, somewhat recently, deep “red,” with uber-conservative Republicans winning election to nearly every major office this year. But what’s also true is that with the fall of Roe in 2022, Montana has become a regional haven for abortion rights. Across much of the Mountain West, abortion rights are under attack and driving a wider loss of health-care options. Idaho in particular has enacted some of the most extreme anti-abortion laws in the country, driving out its own doctors and forcing its own residents to cross state lines for essential health care. But while anti-abortion Republicans swept political offices in Montana again this year, voters also overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment—one of eight states across the country seeking to protect abortion rights—further strengthening the power of pregnant people to make their own health-care decisions without political meddling. Fifty-eight percent of Montana voters supported the measure, the same percentage that voted for Donald Trump as president. It’s a puzzle how voters can elect candidates who work to overturn essential human rights, while voting for a measure to protect this one specific right. Montana clings to its identity as a place that, until recently, had made a big deal of living by the ethos of “do whatever the fuck you want, as long as it’s not harming someone else.” This spirit has been challenged repeatedly since the GOP took super-majority power in the state just a few years ago, leading to vicious attacks on trans Montanans, women, public education, and those seen as threats to the notion of a white, Christian cowboy landscape . But if you go back 50-plus years, things were very different in Montana. Labor unions held immense political power, as grassroots feminists and champions of citizen’s rights and environmental protection helped to write the state’s remarkably progressive constitution. Today those deep progressive political roots are proving stubborn and hard to plow under. In 1972, the League of Women Voters led a group writing a new state constitution. They agreed that privacy deserved a prime spot in the governing document, and as a result, article 2, section 10 of the Montana constitution reads, “The right of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.” There was never much mystery that the section was intended to protect the right to abortion as a medical decision. By setting down the “leave me alone” ethos in the constitution, Montana set itself apart. When the US Supreme Court two years ago ended Roe’s protections and set back human rights for women by decades, states across this region fell under immediate trigger laws—legislation established to ban abortion as soon as the high court made such a decision. Nowhere imposed more restrictive laws than Idaho, from attempting to hold doctors criminally liable for abortion services, to outright banning abortion at all stages of pregnancy. The result has been a mass outward departure from the state by doctors, especially OB-GYNs, and families who don’t want to raise children under laws that harken back to darker, even more dangerous times for women. Today, with the far-right-wing in charge of the state, attacks on abortion rights have quickened and been repeatedly struck down by state courts, leaning on those five-decade-old constitutional protections. Yes, Republicans took control of every statewide elected office, but they did so in part by concealing and obfuscating their plans to ban abortion, ignore the state constitution, and systematically attack the judicial branch that has stood in the way of unconstitutional abortion bans. And yet we again preserved the right to abortion, approved even in deep red counties. Maybe the old “leave us alone” ethos isn’t dead after all. Maybe it’s still lurking under the wave of disinformation and national political identity that has washed over us.. So when you look to red states, red counties, red regions, consider this. We have complex political histories and the Trump-era attacks on civil liberties that are washing over us now just might not be strong enough to erase where we came from. The women of Montana who fought to have our medical privacy protected decades ago likely saw this moment coming. Political extremism and disinformation are eroding our history and our rights, but our backbone isn’t yet broken.",,"['election', 'legislation']",4.0,2025-08-03T16:25:54.236257,5413

Through executive orders, he’s moved to ban trans women and girls from sports, ban federal support of gender-affirming care for people age 19 and younger, and set the stage for a trans military ban under the Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. But no order has likely affected more trans people than the first he signed on Day 1 of his presidency, or “Defending Women From Gender Ideology and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” The order is a federal redefinition of sex—scrubbing all mention of trans people and trans-friendly policy from federal websites, directing federal prisons to remove trans people from the facilities that don’t align with their birth sex, banning the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care (a directive to effectively detransition those same federal prisoners who can’t get hormones any other place) and forcing trans people on Medicaid to pay for pricey drugs out of pocket. At some point, the Office of Personnel Management and Homeland Security will implement changes that require “government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards to accurately reflect the holder’s sex.” Legal challenges are already filed, including a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union challenging the state department’s “refusal to issue accurate sex designations”—these are not laws, they’re directives, and likely unconstitutional power grabs from the executive branch—but so are changes to federal policy. As we wrote last week, trans people can no longer update the gender marker on their passport or the one on file with the Social Security Administration, because, based on this redefinition, we don’t exactly have “gender markers” anymore. Instead, Trump replaced them with sex markers. His administration believes sex is locked at conception. Technically speaking, we’re nothing. We’re sexless. But the complexities, and come to think of it, simplicities, of biology, the prevalence of intersex conditions visible and invisible to the naked eye, and the demonstrable reality of gender variance in daily life, across cultures, and throughout time, is just hooey, they say. Woke, meaningless, irrelevant nonsense that must be snuffed out. We’re starting to see this ideology in practice, and it’s creating real, practical problems for trans people. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has frozen applications from people who’ve requested “X” markers or a binary change of gender, according to Denise Diskin a volunteer attorney with the LGBTQ legal advocacy organization QLaw. It now appears the only one in the business of changing gender markers is Trump: Trans people who have secured emergency replacement passports have had them returned with their gender assigned at birth. To renew a passport, applicants must send in their current one, meaning that many now find themselves without a passport and no clear timeline for when they’ll get one back. In a Friday press release, The ACLU said that 1,500 transgender people or their families had contacted the organization, reporting suspended or pending passport applications. Along with switching gender to sex on federal forms and documents, Trump’s order revoked the option for a gender neutral “X” marker on passports for non-binary people, intersex people, or anyone else who didn’t want a sex identification on their travel document. For Camins Bretts, a bald trans man with a beard and taste for expensive menswear, an “X” marker is practical. His appearance has confused border patrol agents since the 1980s. When he appeared to be a butch woman, agents saw a man fraudulently using a woman’s passport. He had the same problem after he transitioned, and really was a man using a woman’s passport. Bretts recalled all the times he’d been detained at reentry for “false documents” and laughed. “I mean, it’s a story every trans person tells me,” he says. “That’s not unique.” How he’s gendered often depends on who’s looking. The “X” marker could’ve at least put an end to consistent border troubles. On January 22, Bretts applied for an emergency passport with an “X” marker, and scheduled an appointment to pick it up on the 27th, hoping to make some last minute travel plans with friends. A few hours after Rubio reportedly sent a memo to state department employees ending the use of X markers and halting gender marker changes, Bretts’ passport momentarily disappeared in the tracking system and then reappeared three days later. At the appointment, a woman told Bretts their passport was on hold. When Bretts asked for written documentation of that, she said there was none, and no appeals process, either. Looking distressed, the woman told Bretts to print out the executive order as documentation. A supervisor nodded his head behind her. Bretts was unable to apply for a new passport under their assigned gender at birth because the Department had previously issued Bretts passports with both male and female markers. He walked away from the appointment with nothing, and no recourse, so he contacted their congressperson Pramila Jayapal and several legal organizations. On Tuesday, the Seattle passport office called to reaffirm they were not processing “X” passports. Bretts asked if that was a denial of their application, but the office couldn’t say. He’s since received notifications that their application was complete. “Called [passport] helpline,” they texted. “Still Schrodinger’s passport—‘getting ready to manufacture book and card’ according to [the] agent … They could/would not answer my q’s about when it will be ready and what gender is in it.” Evan Reding, a 24-year-old trans masculine person who passes as a cis man in daily life, says having an “F” on his passport is more of a safety concern than anything else. He hadn’t updated any of his documents prior to election day last year, but legally changed his name in December and sent in an application for a new, expedited passport on January 10th, expecting it back by at least January 31. A tracker on the State Department website shows his passport as “processing.” He checks it at least twice a day. He expects to receive a passport with an “F,” but scraping together the $600 he needed to update everything before Trump took office wasn’t easy. Reding says he wouldn’t have been able to do it without his mom’s help. The other trans people, and parents of trans children, who spoke with The Stranger asked us to use their first name or pseudonyms to protect their identities. Bailey, a trans woman also waiting for her passport, says she can afford to lose the $270 she spent, but it’s not why she went through this process. The thought that her passport may return with an “M” marker, adds to her prevailing feeling that the people in charge of this country hate her and people like her. In the months before Trump’s inauguration, 24-year-old Shiloh updated all their documents with a new name and gender marker, except the one on file with the Social Security Administration. Biggest face palm of his life, he says. It’d slipped his mind while recovering from top surgery; it’s also easy to forget. Social Security cards don’t have gender markers. They’re only visible from a SSA database called NUMIDENT, or Numerical Identification System. Shiloh evidently got lucky, or at least secured a just in time appointment with the office. They changed their marker more than a week after Trump’s order went into effect. Four days later, the SSA sent workers an “emergency message” telling them not to process gender marker changes, and to tell applicants they were “not able to accept or process a sex field change,” according to reporting from independent journalist Chris Geidner. The policy is now posted on the agency’s website. James’ daughter is trans, and they’re having trouble getting her a new passport from the State Department. They wanted to update her “X” passport to an “F,” but it’s lost in the government ether now. The family has to decide by Thursday whether or not to cancel an upcoming vacation overseas. James estimates the non-refundable hotel stay and plane tickets will be in the $10,000 range. She’s suggested staying with her grandparents if they can’t work it out in time. But money is just money, he says. But James wonders what would happen if she really needed to leave, and that passport was locked in some kind of bureaucratic morass. James has texted us regular updates about the family’s troubles. On Tuesday, they discovered Social Security processed the name change they’d submitted, but left the gender marker as “M.” That morning, he’d tried talking his way into a passport at a local office—hers was currently listed as “X.” James tried handing the employees his daughter’s updated Washington birth certificate, but says they had a record of the M on her previous passport. “They have no guidance on how to issue one otherwise since X doesn’t exist anymore,” he wrote. “I think having a passport, regardless of gender is better than no passport and being stuck.” The employees were compassionate, and heard him out even though he did not have an appointment, but there was nothing they could do but escalate his problem to their supervisor, who told him to come back with his daughter on Wednesday and submit a new application with an “M” marker. While waiting, he says he overheard employees tell a trans woman that the process had changed, and they’d mail her a passport. She flew in from Alaska, he says. James returned with his daughter on Wednesday, they were told the legal department would have to review her application. He had to write a letter explaining their situation. “I have to go back Friday and either there will be a passport or a letter from legal denying it.” James got neither. The passport office called Friday and explained they were still waiting for guidance, meaning his daughter's passport would remain in limbo. James cancelled the first leg of the family vacation. If things change, they’ll rebook. If they don’t, well, he isn’t so sure. Liz’s trans son came out shortly after the family moved from Seattle to rural Washington. She joked that he should have come out when they lived someplace with resources. But they’ve managed. “Surprisingly,” she said, he’s not the only trans kid. There’s a small community of families like theirs. He’s out at school. His identity is not a secret. Anyone who knows him knows he’s trans, which didn’t stop his civics teacher from polling his class on whether broad acceptance of trans people would be very bad for society. Eighty percent of them said “very bad.” Liz submitted a passport application for her son with an “M” marker on December 23, and arrived a week later on January 1. Liz paid for expedited service, and says the online tracker showed it would arrive in two to three weeks. Five weeks later, it still hasn’t. The tracker shows it is “in process.” Liz thinks her son’s delayed passport has been overwhelming for him, but his main concern is missing out on a trip to Asia this spring. He doesn’t understand the gravity of the situation in the way she does. No one around her seems to. She says it’s as if people almost expect trans people to be discriminated against. They don’t see these orders as extreme as they should. “The thought of an American citizen being denied this and that being okay with people—not just my son, but all trans and non-binary kids and adults,” she says. “To oppress a whole group of people on a federal level. That’s what scares me.”",,"['election', 'policy']",4.0,2025-08-03T16:25:54.238258,11638

https://www.thestranger.com/stranger-election-control-board/2025/07/19/80156072/vote-yes-on-the-king-county-parks-levy,The Stranger,Vote Yes on the King County Parks Levy Just Can't Get Enough?,"Should we or should we not have a county parks system? The question before voters is that simple. Because if voters do not approve this property tax levy, we functionally won’t have one. The 6-year levy, last approved by voters in 2019, will support 250 parks in King County 185 miles of regional trails, 215 miles of backcountry trails and 50 square miles of open space for we, the people, to frolic, picnic, bike, and aimlessly wander. There’s splash parks, pools, ballfields, and play courts of various kinds for racket-oriented aristocrats. If we renew this levy, we maintain that system and homeowners pay 24 cents per thousand dollars of their home value each month. For the median homeowner, that comes out to $16.38 a month. It would generate $1.45 billion over the next six years. If we don’t renew this levy, say goodbye to new infrastructure improvements. Advocates say the county would close parks, or put up signs telling people to recreate at their own risk. Lawns will grow long, hedges wild. After-school programs that depend on county parks funding will suffer. We hope you and your kids like pissing yourselves, because we won’t have anybody to open the restrooms. It’s not a world we want to live in. When the SECB suggested we hold our endorsement meeting in a park, it could not have known we’d meet with this levy’s well-prepared stakeholders on the hottest day of the year so far, a 90+ degree scorcher, with glaring, headache-inducing sunlight bouncing from the concrete like a mirror. We could go on complaining about this thing that was our fault, but it wouldn’t be fair to the people who sat on the porch outside the community center at the genuinely lovely Steve Cox Memorial Park in White Center with us, or the “Log Cabin,” as it is affectionately known. It’d be especially unfair to Fin Crispy Jr., the mascot of the park’s resident summer collegiate baseball team, The DubSea Fish Sticks. They were getting deep fried in there. We didn’t see you leave Fin Crispy Jr., but hope you survived, even if childhood experiences have made some of our stomachs twist into knots whenever mascots are near (it’s a combination of your large size, wide-open, smiling mouths, and mime-like silence. It’s very disconcerting). Like we said, this levy is a no-brainer. It is also uncontested. The advocates, including County Council Member Teresa Mosqueda and Christie True, the county’s former head of natural resources and parks, could have easily shown up, sat down, told us to “vote for this or the parks are screwed,” and called it a day. But they came with data. With a deep love of the parks. Even answers for why the wealthy, who don’t think the county parks are worth a few quarters a day when their backyard, waterfront tennis courts are right there, should vote for this. No matter how rich they are, they don’t own Tiger Mountain, where they race wildly-expensive mountain bikes (yet), or the county-owned pool where little Richie Rich III has his swim meets. If this is you, and “eyesores” are one of your top concerns, consider the weeds. Are you going to schlep a bag and a weeder to your local park, or are you willing to cough up less than a dollar a day so someone else will? We’re willing to bet that’s less than the going rate for a gardener. But those homeowners would probably know better than us. When we pool our money together, we can all have nice things. Even those with little to spare. In Seattle, we’re lousy with parks. But many of the diverse, immigrant populated areas of unincorporated King County aren’t. They depend on this money. Everyone deserves a place to play, to enjoy themselves, to throw a party, to organize a cultural event, and not have to pay for it. Bummed about another property tax? Take it up with the Washington Legislature, which needed to figure out progressive revenue solutions, like, yesterday. Keeping these parks open and thriving at a time when we’re still trying to recover from the isolation and depression of the pandemic and so much public money is under federal threat is literally our civic duty. Vote YES, or don’t let us catch you frolicking in a public green space ever again.",,"['infrastructure', 'parks', 'parks (title)']",3.5,2025-08-03T16:25:54.237258,4163

Sanders said that upon exiting the truck with a drink in hand, the driver refused to cooperate with commands and tried to run inside their house. The sheriff reported that the suspect ""doused me in the face and eyes with what smelled like sweet liquor,"" leading to a physical altercation. During the struggle, the suspect grabbed the sheriff's vest, turned off the radio, and ripped off the lapel mic. The suspect also grabbed the sheriff's throat. A taser was deployed but failed due to the close proximity. A nearby neighbor intervened, helping Sanders subdue the suspect. A K9 arrived on the scene and bit the suspect on the ear, prompting the suspect to surrender. The suspect was placed in a WRAP restraint system due to continued threats and resistance. A warrant was obtained to test the suspect's blood for intoxicants, and he was taken to the hospital for medical clearance. The suspect will face charges including reckless driving, DUI, felony assault on a peace officer, obstructing, resisting arrest, failure to obey a police officer, and driving on a suspended license. The suspect's family told the TCSO they had offered him a ride home from an event, which he refused, and that he did not have permission to drive the family company vehicle. The decision was made not to impound the vehicle, as the family needed it for their livelihood. The neighbor who assisted the deputy was awarded a Sheriff challenge coin for their swift action.",,['police'],2.0,2025-08-03T16:27:04.101198,2396

The order is blocked for the next 14 days. King, a Biden appointee, said Trump’s executive order intended to erase transgender people and “blatantly discriminated against trans youth.” The decision came less than 24 hours after a judge in Maryland temporarily blocked the order nationwide. King believed that Trump’s executive order—titled “Protecting Children From Chemical and Surgical Mutilation”— was not likely to “survive judicial scrutiny” because it subverted the power of Congress to distribute money for potentially lifesaving gender-affirming care and violated equal protection under the 5th Amendment by not funding trans health care, while continuing to fund the same, or similar treatments, for cisgender children. Judge King’s temporary restraining order comes exactly one week after Washington Attorney General Nick Brown sued over Trump’s order. As AG Brown said at a news conference announcing the suit, the order not only threatened to defund hospitals and research institutions that provided this care, but possibly prosecute providers. Transgender people across the country have lost care because doctors and hospitals took those threats seriously, including Seattle Children’s Hospital, which last week postponed a trans teen’s masculinizing top surgery the night before it was scheduled, attracting protest from trans people, parents of trans kids, and their supporters. During the hearing, Washington Deputy Solicitor General Tera Heintz argued Trump’s order was “open and unapologetic bigotry” that rejected the overwhelming medical consensus that gender-affirming care is safe and effective for children. She read comments from a plaintiff in the case, a doctor who has treated hundreds of trans children, and remains anonymous for fear of retribution.“There are going to be young people who take their lives if they can no longer receive this care,” she read. “Without access to this care, transgender adolescents will die—I am certain of it.” Heintz said the states’ lawyers had introduced a mound of evidence showing how gender-affirming care, introduced in slow and deliberate stages, drastically improved children’s lives, Heintz said. Heintz also said that this order reads as an implict threat to providers because it equates all trans care to “chemical and surgical mutilation,” and asks the Department of Justice to review and prioritize laws against female genital mutilation, or the cutting, sewing, or removal of the labia or clitoris for non-medical reasons. Now it was the government’s burden to prove, with evidence, that it is the mutilation it claims it is. It could not. The government’s lawyer, Vinita Andrapalliyal, argued the President had the constitutional authority to direct his agency heads to take appropriate next steps on a “policy preference.” It is possible the order “could be implemented lawfully,” she said, and until an agency revoked any grant, the court did not have to decide, and should wait to see how this “shakes out.” Her argument fell apart a few minutes later when Judge King started asking simple questions, like: Were all the treatments as “irreversible” as the order claimed they were? “No, I don’t think we specifically say one way or the other—” Vinita Andrapalliyal said. “I’m asking you today,” King interjected. “I don’t—I don’t know, I’m here today—” “You have not looked into it.” “I’m here within the lawfulness of the executive order—” “This is part of it,” King said. “Do you have any evidence that all of the treatments listed in the executive order are irreversible?” Andrapalliyal said she had evidence of the President’s policy prerogative to not fund the “so-called transition of a child from one sex to another.” “But we’re looking at goals here—irreversible treatment is central to the goals. You haven’t looked into that at all. You don’t have an answer for me today.” This carried on for 13 more excruciating minutes. When King asked for an example of the order targeting similar treatment for cisgender people, there was a thirty second pause. When King asked if the government would allow doctors to prescribe puberty blockers, a drug given to both cisgender and transgender children to delay the onset of puberty, to a cisgender boy with prostate cancer, while disallowing doctors from giving the same medication to a transgender girl with the same condition, there was another long pause. After disagreement about the meaning of the text, Andrapalliyal reiterated that the President is asking his agencies to take next steps consistent with the law, and they don’t yet know those steps. King posed another hypothetical: A recently married, 18-year-old cisgender man with Huntington’s Disease gets a vasectomy because he does not want to pass it onto his children. Was that included in the government’s refusal to support the alteration or removal of an individual’s sex organs to “minimize or destroy their natural biological functions?” “I don’t know,” Andrapalliyal said. “Can you read the text and let me know what you think?” King asked. Another pause, which like the others, was filled with snickering from an obviously queer audience. (Before the hearing, activists had circulated a flier encouraging people to “pack the court.” At 9:20, forty minutes before the hearing, the line for security nearly snaked out the door. Every seat was taken, even in the overflow room.) “I’m not a medical provider,” Andrapalliyal said. “If you can’t figure it out—how is a medical provider supposed to know that?” King said. “This is not a medical text. This is an executive order.” After back and forth of when and how medical providers were supposed to determine a person’s birth sex, for which Andrapalliyal had no answers, she said there were a lot of unknowns. “Medical providers have no direction on where to go because you can’t read the text and apply it to various facts,” King said, sharply exhaling. “This is extremely frustrating, counsel.” At courthouse steps, a reporter asked AG Brown what he thought of this exchange. “A bit embarrassing,” he said to laughter and applause, but he later turned serious. “I want to remind people that the Department of Justice was created to defend civil rights,” he said. “What we’re seeing from this President is a specific undermining of its purpose, a specific directive to no longer defend civil rights, and it is upsetting to me, personally and professionally.” Indigo, a nonbinary person who responded to the activist call to “pack the court,” said it was important to show up in numbers to support the community, even just to be a “body in a room.” They’re also Asian-American, and went through the “whole China virus thing” during COVID-19, so they knew how Trump’s comments could galvanize people with bigoted views to take violent action. Standing in the courtyard outside, Danni Askini, executive director of the Seattle-based trans advocacy organization Gender Justice League, wondered if the “shock and awe” effect of the Trump Administration is their “own undoing.” “They’ve pushed so much stuff down on the Department of Justice, and they’re firing people left and right,” she says. “Who wants to work in a politicized law firm like the DOJ as it is now? I really feel for the Assistant US Attorney who argued the case.” After all, the DOJ essentially failed to make the same case twice this week. On Thursday, US District Judge Brendan Hurson of Maryland also issued a temporary restraining order blocking Trump’s order. During the hearing, Hurson said he was skeptical that the government’s order was not effectively banning care nationwide by threatening to pull funding from hospitals and research institutions that provide or study transgender care for youth and young adults. Patients had received phone calls stopping care, stopping their appointments, stopping their “everything,” he said. “I don’t know how you can credibly argue that this is not demanding the cessation of funding for gender affirming care.” Whether or not hospitals needed to comply with Trump’s order in the first place is unclear. Executive orders are not laws. They’re directives to federal agencies. As of today, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s Department of Health and Human Services has not issued a new rule on trans care. Even if it had, any policy change would be subject to the Administrative Procedure Act. The rule would undergo public comment. Implementation should take months if not years. However, the Trump administration has a, let’s say, creative approach to current law and administrative procedure. During today’s hearing, Heintz told Judge King that at least one recipient of a federal grant at the University of Washington received a five sentence notice from Health and Human Services that told them to terminate any program in conflict with the executive order. King remarked that the title of the email indicated it was likely sent to all recipients of those grants. President2 Elon Musk and Vice President JD Vance have openly questioned the judiciary’s authority over the executive branch. We don’t know what those Yankees teach over at their fancy-schmancy Yale Law School, but that is very much the point of the courts. But Vance is not one to let knowledge get in the way of power. Seattle Children’s filed a declaration in support of Brown’s lawsuit, where Jeffrey J. Ojemann, the hospital’s senior vice president and chief physician executive, argued that losing federal funds would be cataclysmic. He explained the hospital’s research program employs more than 375 faculty investigators, and 100 postdoctoral scholars, who study every “aspect of pediatric health and disease,” including childhood cancer and blood disorders, immunotherapy, infectious diseases, neurological disorders and respiratory diseases. Research takes money, a lot of it federal funds: In 2024, the hospital was awarded nearly $185 million in federal research grants. According to a lawyer from the ACLU, Hurson’s decision should give hospitals like Children’s the confidence to care for their patients without risking their funding. AG Brown reiterated that point today. “I want to encourage all of the providers in this state, in the state of Oregon and the state of Minnesota to get back to work,” he said. It appears that’s already happening. After the hearing, The Stranger checked in with Sarah, the mother of the trans teen whose top surgery Children’s postponed last week. She’d just gotten a call from the hospital to reschedule her son’s surgery. Children’s did not confirm if it had resumed all forms of gender-affirming care, but thanked AG Brown for filing the complaint “so that Seattle Children’s has the clarity needed at this time to deliver on our mission while ensuring we operate within all applicable laws.” Temporary restraining orders are just that. Temporary. The state will likely seek a preliminary-injunction, an order that will last longer than 14 days.",,['policy'],1.0,2025-08-03T16:25:54.230517,11229

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2024/12/19/79832605/having-an-iud-is-great-getting-one-can-be-terrible,The Stranger,Having an IUD is Great. Getting One Can Be Terrible Just Can't Get Enough?,"The appeal of the IUD is undeniable: When you can get pregnant and don’t want to, 10 baby-free years feels like a miracle, something you’d be willing to suffer for at least a little. But for a lot of patients, the pain that comes with an IUD insertion is way more than “a little.” And worse, the pain is often downplayed by providers—if it’s even addressed at all. When Rep. Amy Walen (D-48) accompanied a young woman to an insertion appointment, she found this lack of pain control horrifying. So horrifying that she’s prefiled a bill for the upcoming 2025 legislative session addressing it. House Bill 1077 would require clinicians to discuss pain management with patients before IUD insertions. Walen hopes her bill will raise awareness about the very real pain that can accompany this extremely routine procedure: IUDs are one of the most popular forms of long-acting birth control on the market. She wants to keep other people from experiencing the intense pain she witnessed in the patient she accompanied, whose pain was intense and unrelenting. “It was really, really upsetting how painful it was for her,” said Walen. With state legislatures across the country understandably focused on abortion access since the reversal of Roe v. Wade, it’s unusual to see policies like Walen’s, which specifically focus on IUDs. But maybe it shouldn’t be. If you’ve ever gotten an IUD—or talked to a fellow drunk girl in a bathroom line for just a little too long—the pain that can accompany an insertion is not new information. When I surveyed IUD users—or would-be users—about their experiences most recently, I was immediately flooded with responses describing “mind-bending pain,” prolonged failed insertion attempts, repeated uses of the word “brutal,” and comparisons to things like “a small dragon … trying to claw out of my body for 24-36 hours.” These were concerning, but they were also deeply familiar. Stories like these are the subject of casual conversations over brunch or a beer. One friend of mine described pain that lingered for days after her insertion. Another, who fainted during her appointment, attempted to put a positive spin on things: “One shining silver lining was my nurse was a hot dyke and caught me when I fell off the table and I woke up in her arms,” she said. Removal was memorably bad, too, for a former colleague of mine. “When having it extracted, my doctor (and an intern) couldn’t get it out,” she said. “He spent 30 or 45 minutes yanking on it from various angles as I tried not to scream.” My editor knows a woman whose first IUD insertion was so painful that years later, when she returned to get it replaced, she had a full-blown panic attack. Her body was so tense that they weren't able to safely complete the procedure. Even women who’ve given birth describe the pain of IUD insertion on particularly gnarly terms. Elinor Jones, better known as the celebrity gossip columnist at our sister paper the Mercury, described an insertion attempt that had to be stopped because it was so painful it was “like knives.” Annie Jurrens, who’s been through two unmedicated births, described her IUD insertion as one of “acute pain, like being stabbed in an internal organ.” Given the grim state of reproductive health care in America, stories like these—where things really devolved, but no one died or was permanently injured—might seem like minor inconveniences, hot nurse or not. And juxtaposed with the horrors visited upon people who had first-generation IUDs like the infamous Dalkon Shield, perhaps they are. A claw-like device with a sci-fi name, the Dalkon Shield’s design led so many users to develop pelvic inflammatory disease that it became the subject of one of the largest tort liability cases in history. It’s an unqualified good thing that the Dalkon Shield is off the market, but its existence seems to have set the bar in hell for future IUD experiences. You wouldn’t know this from the next-gen IUDs’ branding, ensconced in the soft focus of marketplace feminism, with imaginary girls’ names that sound like they’re written in cursive on a wooden sign inside HomeGoods: Skyla, Mirena, Kyleena. (The eminently practical ParaGard is the only exception to this: As the oldest and only non-hormonal option in the gang, the copper T is like the used Subaru hatchback of IUDs, and I mean that as the highest praise.) Despite this rosy marketing—and the very real pain they felt—the IUD users I spoke to said they received little or no advance warning that their procedures might be painful. Some were told just to take ibuprofen beforehand, others weren’t even given that advice. One was told scheduling the insertion during her period would make it easier, “but it just resulted in the whole fiasco being an absolute bloodbath,” she said. There’s a reason for this bizarro dissonance between brutal patient experiences and provider attitudes toward pain management and support: Research suggests that patients and providers perceive the pain of IUD insertion differently. A 2015 study published in The European Journal of Contraception & Reproductive Health Care found that while most IUD insertions “appeared acceptable to most patients,” providers “tended to underestimate the degree of pain experienced by their patients during IUD insertion procedures.” That could be changing. Earlier this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines for clinicians inserting IUDs to encourage conversations about pain management with patients before the speculum comes out. The CDC now recommends the use of topical or injected lidocaine, which numbs the cervix. Misoprostol, also used in medication abortions, may be helpful for some patients, but it’s not suggested for typical use. It’s not clear what role, if any, legislative policies like Walen’s will have in advancing these updated clinical guidelines, beyond drawing attention to them. Sarah Prager, an abortion provider in Seattle, was skeptical of the approach. “There already exists a lot of guidance around offering/providing pain management for IUD insertions (including newer advice from the CDC within the Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) for Contraception Use (published updates this year),” she said. “I 100% agree expanded options for pain management should be offered/available, but I disagree that legislation is the appropriate vehicle for achieving this.” But one thing is always worth remembering: A good doctor (the kind you deserve) will realize you’re in pain, and do something about it. “I was ready to power through,” said Jones. “I am grateful for my (female) doctor being like ‘You are in too much pain and I don’t recommend continuing.’” But if you’re at the doctor’s office and something is painful, you’re allowed to speak up.",,['legislation'],1.0,2025-08-03T16:25:54.241637,6780

His family, with the help of national advocates including the Gabby Petito Foundation, is determined to bring him home safely. PREVIOUS COVERAGE | 1st possible sighting of missing man with autism in Kirkland renews hope for family ""We need help finding Jonathan, and we can’t do it by ourselves,"" said Thao Hoang, Jonathan's father. More than 120 days have passed since Jonathan vanished from his family's home, with no trace of him found save for a brief sighting in late June. Surveillance footage from multiple neighbors on the night of June 23 showed a young man resembling Hoang in the South Juanita area near 105th Avenue Northeast and Northeast 112th Street. His family continues to search for answers. ""We’re just wondering what happened. He appeared and then disappeared, and we’re feeling a little frantic right now,"" said Ann Hoang, Jonathan's mother. The ""Honk and Wave"" rally, held at the corner of Broadway and Hewitt in Everett, aimed to raise awareness of Jonathan's disappearance and demonstrate community unity. National groups like the Gabby Petito Foundation and 'Light the Way' joined local volunteers to spread awareness. ""It was a godsend when they contacted us and said 'Hey, we would like to help you,' and it was such a big relief for us because, like Ann said, we were desperate. It felt like we were alone,"" Thao said. Community members have also reached out to offer assistance. ""People reach out to us and ask how can we help find Jonathan and bringing awareness is really the key,"" Thao added. Jonathan, who is autistic and verbal but considered vulnerable, was last credibly sighted just over a month ago on a home security camera in Kirkland. His family believes he is still alive and in need of help. Family and supporting organizations have also stated they believe Jonathan was most likely coerced or taken from his home.

The rally brought together more than 1,000 protesters at Cal Anderson Park, and then, with the assistance of car escorts and bike blockades, they marched to the federal building, stretching across blocks at a time. And it wasn't the only protest in the region. At the same time, 200 lawyers were ceremonially retaking their oath at the King County Superior Court, and immigrant advocates were marching on the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma. There are May Day protests in every major city every year, but this year, they drew from the same kind of energy—even on a Thursday—that the Hands Off! protests harnessed in April. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators protested across the country. This is the kind of progressive coalition building we need. Earlier this month, Stranger columnist Kendall Turner asked social scientists if we know what makes a successful protest movement. She wrote that “we know that over the last century, almost no protest movement that has mobilized 3.5 percent of a population has failed to achieve its goals.” Hands Off! didn’t hit those numbers—the highest estimates were 1 percent of the population—and neither did yesterday’s, but gatherings like these are how we build the foundation to get to that 3.5 percent. “Few things stop a movement’s momentum as quickly as not having something to do next,” wrote Turner. “Numbers matter, yes, but so does consistency in participation in a protest movement.” Stranger contributing photographer Brittne Lunniss captured it all, so if you weren’t able to make it, here’s a little taste of the magic. And if you can, get down to Olympia tomorrow for the All Labor March!",,[],0.0,2025-08-03T16:25:54.241263,1807
https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/05/01/80037709/wisconsin-judges-arrest-couldnt-have-happened-in-washington,The Stranger,Wisconsin Judge’s Arrest Couldn’t Have Happened in Washington Just Can't Get Enough?,"Last Friday, the FBI arrested Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan, claiming that she helped a migrant avoid arrest from federal immigration authorities. While highly irregular, according to law professionals, there is precedent for this arrest—pretty much the same situation happened in 2019 during the first Trump administration. A Massachusetts judge ushered a defendant out of a courtroom where Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers laid in wait, ready to do some arresting. That judge faced charges (though wasn’t dragged out in handcuffs in the public, performative way Dugan was). President Joe Biden ultimately tossed out the charges in the 2019 case. Whether or not Dugan did what she’s accused of, there’s precedent for judges acting in this way. And, no, Attorney General Pam Bondi, this is not “radical leftist judges” standing in the way of Trump’s agenda. These behaviors are a reaction to ICE’s continued presence in US courtrooms causing a chilling effect on the legal system and making it harder for courts to do their job. Washington, still a bastion of sanity in some arenas, tackled this ghoulish ICE behavior back in 2020 with a law banning courthouse arrests without warrants, and blocking staff—including lawyers, judges, and security officers—from tipping off ICE. It’s the kind of check on power that we used to rely on the legal system to provide. This started back in December 2019, when Mary E. Fairhurst, then the chief justice of the Washington Supreme Court, penned a letter to presiding judges around Washington about ICE presence at the courts. “The problem of immigration arrests at or around our courthouses has deeply troubled me because of the effect it has on our immigrant populations and the growing perception that we are a cooperating entity in those arrests,” Fairhurst wrote. According to Christopher Sanders, a former federal public defender in Seattle, ICE is a constant presence at state courthouses. “Clients would be arrested by ICE at their state courthouse hearings and then brought down the street and charged with immigration crime,” Sanders said. Sanders said these officers usually come into courtrooms and don’t identify themselves. They’re often in plain clothes. Fairhurst’s letter continued: “I do oppose using our locations as the site for those arrests. Our courthouses should be treated as “sensitive locations” like schools and hospital, as a place where everyone should be free to come and go without fear. Our courthouse should not be used as a magnet for targeting certain populations, regardless of their legal status.” The outrage turned into House Bill 2567 during the 2019-2020 legislative session. The bill contained safeguards outlawing warrantless civil immigration arrests at state courthouses. Beyond that, the bill stopped courts from collecting information about immigration status unless relevant to a person’s trial and prevented anyone sharing private personal information with ICE—they couldn’t even alert ICE about who would be in the courtroom. Additionally, under the bill, court security started collecting the names and purposes of all ICE officers who showed up on any particular day and they alerted judges ahead of proceedings about the officers’ presence. Sanders and his wife, Erika Evans, who is now running for Seattle City Attorney, jumpstarted a letter writing campaign with the Minority and Justice Commission in support of HB 2567. Their letters advocated for the bill, but also addressed the question of whether a court could be truly impartial if it didn’t willingly let the people within its walls be detained by ICE—a question that is paramount in Dugan’s arrest. “We do not believe that HB 2567 jeopardizes the independence of the judiciary,” the Minority and Justice Commission letter read. “Rather, it recognizes the sanctity of courthouses, the rule of law, and the critical role that court personnel play in fostering public confidence in the judicial branch. Access to our courts is fundamental to a functioning democracy.” Unfortunately, our federal government seems far more interested in theatrics than in maintaining a functioning democracy. Judges who act in the interest of access and fairness, like Dugan may have, will instead face the wrath of Bondi. “I think some of these judges think they are beyond and above the law, and they are not,” Bondi told Fox News in an interview last week. “We are sending a very strong message today: If you are harboring a fugitive, we don’t care who you are. If you are helping hide one, if you are giving a [gang] member guns, anyone who is illegally in this country, we will come after you, and we will prosecute you. We will find you.”",,[],0.0,2025-08-03T16:25:54.239263,4703
https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/06/26/80119416/aegis-fires-two-workers-for-sharing-stranger-article-union-and-employees-say,The Stranger,"Aegis Fires Two Workers for Sharing Stranger Article, Union and Employees Say Just Can't Get Enough?","Imagine getting fired for sharing an article with your co-workers. Not porn, not political commentary, not raunchy jokes. A news article, just like this one. According to two employees at Aegis Living, it just happened in King County twice. Jason Bova-Havers says that on their day off on May 27th, a former co-worker sent him something to read: a story published last month in The Stranger titled, “What’s Behind the Gilded Doors of Aegis Living?” The article contained allegations against the senior living chain Aegis Living from employees, former employees, and families of residents, ranging from shady business practices to illegal anti-union actions, discrimination, elder neglect, and more. Bova-Havers had worked for Aegis for the past five years, so naturally they were curious. They told The Stranger that they weren't all that surprised about what was reported in the article, but still felt like it was worth passing along. Maybe this is something my boss should see, they remember thinking, and dropped a link to the story in a group chat he had going with a co-worker and his immediate boss. Two days later, during their shift as a line cook at Aegis Living Shoreline, Bova-Havers was called into the General Manager’s office, their boss’ boss. “You’re going to want to sit down,” Bova-Havers says a Human Resources rep told them. “You recently sent a text message to your coworkers that was seen as ‘below board.’ So we’re letting you go.” That was it. Will Hudson read that same article, also passed to him by a friend. It was about the company he’d worked for the past two and a half years, first as care staff then recently as a member of the maintenance team at Aegis Living Madison. While he was at work the next day he printed the article off in the employee break room so his co-workers could read it, too. “I just wanted to inform them, see what their opinions and takes around it were,” Hudson says. Then he went back to work. “Didn’t think nothing of it.” When Hudson came into work on June 9th, he was called into his boss’s office and questioned. He says they’d interviewed a couple of his co-workers already before he was called in to his boss’s office. “Are you the one who printed off this paper?” he says he was asked. “Yes,” Hudson says he replied. “We don’t allow that here. We have to let you go,” he says he was told. Aegis did not respond to The Stranger’s request for comment about the two fired workers. They also did not respond to repeated requests for comment over months of reporting for the original article, and in the month since publication has not issued any public statement refuting the article’s wide-ranging allegations. Since these firings, SEIU 775 has filed Unfair Labor Practice charges with the National Labor Relations Board against Aegis Living, alleging the company “unlawfully terminated” the two workers for “concerted, protected activities” covered by the National Labor Relations Act. The complaint states “due to the egregious and hallmark nature of this violation” the union is seeking injunctive relief that would allow these workers to be reinstated with back pay. Even though Bova-Havers and Hudson weren’t members of the union, SEIU sees their firings as an attempt by Aegis to cool pro-union activity. “We're going to push as hard as we can to get them to take action on these complaints,” says Adam Glickman, the Secretary Treasurer of SEIU 775. He sees this as a first-amendment fight, made even more important in the current political climate. “It's just outrageous that in the middle of a workforce crisis where long-term care facilities are struggling to hire caregivers, particularly this company Aegis that pays less than most other employers, that they would fire workers for sharing newspaper articles,” Glickman says. “It seems like a slap in the face to their residents that they care so little about their care that they would fire workers for such an absurd reason. They're so afraid, so anti-union, so afraid of their workers organizing, that they would endanger the care of their residents by firing people for sharing a news article. It's just shocking.” But no matter how it happened, Bova-Havers and Hudson are out of their jobs. Luckily, both Bova-Havers and Hudson have been able to find work since. Bova-Havers is happy at his new full-time job as a pastry chef, which was his original job at Aegis. “I do miss my crew in the kitchen,” he says. “I worry about them. I hope they get better pay and protections. Or, hell, just jobs that appreciate them.” Will has found some work dog sitting and dog walking, but he’s still looking for something long-term. And he’s still upset about what happened. “After being fired, I was devastated,” Will says. “The residents that’d see me every day, now I don’t get to see them anymore. All because Aegis doesn’t want people to know the truth: that Aegis is corrupt.” Have a tip about Aegis Living? Reach out at editor@thestranger.com.",,[],0.0,2025-08-03T16:25:54.233949,4965

Deputies responded to the scene on July 30 around 6 a.m. to find the vehicle abandoned in the parking lot. According to surveillance footage, the maroon car had been parked at a nearby AutoZone since the previous day. The driver had informed employees that the vehicle was not functioning properly and that he would return to tow it. At approximately 3:45 a.m., a white Honda Pilot with a dolly attempted to tow the maroon car. The vehicle was initially pulled from its parking spot around 5:15 a.m., but the tow strap failed, leaving it at the far end of the parking lot. A second attempt to secure the vehicle around 5:50 a.m. resulted in the vehicle rolling down the lot and crashing into the restaurant. The Honda driver made a third attempt to tow the vehicle, but the strap broke again, causing the car to crash into the restaurant a second time. Ultimately, the driver and a female passenger abandoned the maroon car after it became stuck along a retention wall and curb.

The Kraken were in Anchorage for their annual partnership trip with the Bristol Bay Native Corporation, a union that brings a blend of hockey and community engagement to hockey fans in Alaska. RELATED | Seattle Kraken in the news - matches, players, and more The week-long event included a hockey camp hosted by the Anchorage Hockey Academy. The camp featured Kraken forward John Hayden, the team's mascot Buoy, and various youth hockey coaches from the Kraken organization. However, during a fly fishing excursion on June 25 in Katmai National Park, an uninvited guest showed up - a grizzly bear. Video provided by Kraken shows the bear watching the fisherpeople from the other side of the shallow river. As its presence is flagged and everyone begins to quickly evacuate the water, the bear is seen advancing on them, rushing toward the group and sending spray flying before veering away again. It seemed particularly interested in the blue-haired Buouy, who, ever the good sport, never stopped smiling as he slogged away to safety. ""I want to blame it on Buoy. They were pretty interested in his whole look. We got out of it okay, but it was a close call,"" Hayden said. During the trip, the Kraken visited their 2025 Make-A-Wish recipient, Caleb, and his family. The team revealed that Caleb and his family would be traveling to Seattle for a game and a special Kraken experience in January. The Seattle Kraken have partnered with the Bristol Bay Native Corporation for the past four years, focusing on growing youth hockey in Alaska and promoting sustainability goals in the Pacific Northwest region and beyond.",,[],0.0,2025-08-03T16:27:04.100197,1935
