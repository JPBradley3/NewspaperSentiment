https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/seattle-council-keeps-renters-commission-without-landlords/,Seattle Times (Archived),Seattle council keeps renters’ commission without landlords,"The Seattle City Council confirmed 14 members of the city’s renter’s commission Tuesday, days after a dustup last week. The appointment of volunteers to serve on any of the city’s many advisory commissions is generally pro forma and done with little fanfare or notice. But controversy over the renter’s commission appointments gave a peak into larger and more thorny debates in City Hall over the city’s landlord-tenant rules and whose voices are valued within halls of power. The commission, established in 2017, has operated with just five members for the last year and a half — a third of the 15 it’s supposed to have. In the council’s housing committee last week, councilmembers were scheduled to remedy that by voting on 14 nominations.

Trump campaigned on tougher policies toward visible homelessness and street disorder. Homelessness is at a record high locally and nationally. King County recorded 16,868 homeless people in its 2024 Point-in-Time Count. Across the country, the number was 771,480 people. Homelessness and mental health advocates said Thursday’s order, Trump’s first aimed at homelessness since taking office in January, would not only infringe on human rights and be difficult to enforce, but it would likely be ineffective at reducing homelessness or addressing mental health and substance use issues. Those who work in those fields said forcing people into treatmen...",2025-07-26T06:00:00-07:00,"['mayor', 'policy', 'housing', 'homeless', 'development']"
