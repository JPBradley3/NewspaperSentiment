In case you haven’t been following the election so far (and with totalitarian takeover on our heels, we’d understand), here’s your chance to catch up. The filing deadlines are in early May, so there’s still time for some surprises, but even now, the election is shaping up to be an interesting one. This year, we have a mayor’s race featuring an embattled moderate incumbent who speaks the language of progressivism, but governs like a conservative. We’ve got a challenger for the District 9 City Council seat and a wide-open race in District 2. And finally, a City Attorney race, where anyone with an ounce of progressivism (or human decency) has been eager to unseat the incumbent from the moment she took office. We’ve got months before endorsement time, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t meet the candidates who have thrown their hats in the ring. Without further ado, here’s our quick breakdown of the local elections so far. Bruce Harrell, Seattle’s very own Chamber of Commerce sock puppet, finally has some challengers. The biggest name in the game so far is Katie Wilson: a street-fighting policy wonk who’s built a strong, progressive reputation actually winning battles for working people (raising the minimum wage, keeping transit affordable). When she launched her campaign, she told The Stranger about the kind of mayor she hopes to be: a coalition builder who’s able to reach across the aisle to find common goals, without diluting progressive, research-backed policies. She described herself as someone who’s willing to test new ideas and push forward on issues that have stagnated in this city for a decade. She’s untested in elected office—or even running in an election—but she urged voters to look at her record as a policy advocate. “I’ve spent the last 14 years of my career organizing, building powerful coalitions that win major victories for working people,” she told The Stranger. “And I’ve done all that from the outside. I would be happy to put my legislative record up against Bruce Harrell’s any day of the week.” Then there’s Ry Armstrong, an MLK Labor Delegate for SAG-AFTRA and an elected member of the Actor’s Equity Association, repping 50,000 actors from Texas to Hawaii. This is Armstrong’s second go at elected office. In 2023, they ran for Kshama Sawant’s City Council seat in District 3, and while progressives generally got wildly outspent by big business (and therefore creamed) in that election, Armstrong’s showing was particularly rough. Only 1.86 percent of the electorate (a total of 488 people) voted for Armstrong in that race. They’re proud of their big ideas, and a suite of progressive taxes to pay for them. Ry and Katie are joined in the race by a handful of other candidates, including: MAGA-y Rachael Savage, the Republican who is campaigning to block permanent supportive housing and arrest homeless addicts as means of recovery; and Joe Molloy, a homeless man who says he lost his housing last year due to an unsupported disability, and is running his grassroots campaign from Tent City 3. Seattle’s City Council President Sara Nelson has been on the council since 2022 and has been president since 2024. Her leadership has represented the Chamber of Commerce (and Amazon’s) bid to claim control of city government, so we’re very pleased to announce that she has a challenger. Her name is Dionne Foster, progressive policy wonk, and capital gains tax champion. Nelson, known for her right-leaning, business-first politics, might be in trouble, given the city’s enthusiastic support for progressive Alexis Mercedes Rinck in November, and the runaway success of February’s social housing initiative. Foster’s got the right ideas on housing and homelessness, but let’s be real, to quote a Reddit-er, if a rock ran against Nelson, some Seattleites would probably throw a vote its way just to avoid the “right-wing, inept millionaire” vibe. At the end of last year, Tammy Morales stepped down from her seat representing D2 on City Council, saying that the conservative, business-oriented City Council was a toxic, undemocratic environment. The council appointed Seattle Police Department crime prevention coordinator and long-time City Council hopeful Mark Solomon to hold down the seat until this year’s election, when it goes back to the people. So who’s gonna replace the progressive Morales? In the battle for D2’s vote, we start with Assistant City Attorney Eddie Lin, who primarily works with the Office of Housing. He describes himself as a champion of affordable housing, progressive revenue, and creating a city where “artists and bike messengers and baristas and educators can all afford to live here.” So far, he’s light on details for how he plans to do that, so we’ll be watching him closely. Then there’s Adonis Ducksworth, the Mayor’s senior transportation policy official and one of the architects of the 2024 transportation levy. He’s pushing a platform that combines safety, affordability, and... skate parks? The lifelong skateboarder knows how important public space is for kids (yay) but he also believes safety in D2 comes with more cops (boo). Like Lin, though, he hasn’t offered many other details yet. Eclipsing both of their fundraising, though, is a newer entrant: Takayo Minakami Ederer, a Columbia City-born real estate investor and karate instructor (and one of the first members of the women’s national karate team). Based on her early interviews, she’s largely running on a “public safety” platform—which, you guessed it, to her means more cops. She also acknowledges that we need more shelter beds, and advocates for a public-private partnership to make that happen. In our friendly neighborhood City Attorney showdown, Nathan Rouse, Rory O’Sullivan, and Erika Evans all have big ideas on how to fix Seattle’s broken justice system in contrast to incumbent Ann Davison—spoiler alert: most of them don’t involve locking up more people. Rouse, a public defender who’s done with Davison’s “tough-on-crime” charade, wants to bring back community court and stop prosecuting minor offenses like SODA and SOAP violations (which, fun fact, aren’t even being enforced right now). Meanwhile, Evans is focusing on serving up anti-Trump tea and advocating for harm reduction programs that actually help people instead of shoving them into jail. And then there’s O’Sullivan, who thinks the City Attorney’s office could use a little more compassion and a little less spectacle. So, get ready for a race that could decide whether Seattle stays stuck in the criminal justice quicksand or finally tries to pull itself out with actual solutions.

https://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2025/04/toxic-politics-supportive-housing-project-targeted-by-capitol-hill-mayoral-candidate-in-line-for-state-cleanup/,Capitol Hill Seattle,"CHS Capitol Hill Seattle News Toxic politics? ‘Supportive housing’ project targeted by Capitol Hill mayoral candidate in line for state cleanup LATEST CHS SUBSCRIBER TOTAL: 1,236","The Capitol Hill business owner turned candidate for mayor fighting a Belmont Ave supportive housing project from the Downtown Emergency Service Center has already cast herself as a Republican. Now we’ll see if Rachael Savage is also an environmentalist. Washington’s Department of Ecology may be wandering into a neighborhood hornet’s nest as it begins the public process on the Stewart House Cleanup Site under its affordable housing grant program. The DESC and the department are entering into an agreement on a state funded cleanup of the site where decades of waste from oil furnaces has accumulated. The Belmont Ave properties home to a trio of former transitional housing buildings from Pioneer Human Services were acquired in a $6.5 million deal last year as the DESC made plans for a new 120-unit apartment building with onsite services for its residents on the block. A 30-day public comment period on the cleanup agreement ends at midnight on May 6th. “Many communities in Washington are facing a housing crunch, but one Ecology program is helping to ease the shortage,” the state’s announcement of public comment window reads. “Our Affordable Housing Cleanup Grant Program provides grants to developers to help clean up contaminated sites. In return, the developers redevelop the property, with at least 40% of the square footage slated for affordable housing for at least 30 years.” The documents from the agreement are posted here. “The properties have historically been the site of apartment buildings heated by oil furnaces. Soil at the cleanup site has been contaminated by petroleum products that leaked out of underground storage tanks,” the state says. “The extent of the contamination will be studied during the future remedial investigation phase.” The state grant process around the projects has been streamlined by the legislature. In 2022, the permanent program was established to provide the grants for planning and cleanup of contaminated sites intended for affordable development. But the process adds another wrinkle to the DESC’s plans in the neighborhood. CHS broke the news on the project this fall as the organization confirmed its planning for “a new Permanent Supportive Housing project” on the parcels it purchased over the summer. King County’s program to fund the projects says permanent supportive housing is housing “for a household that is homeless on entry, where the individual or a household member has a condition of disability, such as mental illness, substance abuse, chronic health issues, or other conditions that create multiple and serious ongoing barriers to housing stability.” City permitting is already approved to demolish the vacant buildings to make way for the new 120-unit DESC permanent supportive housing project. An August fire mostly destroyed one of the buildings waiting to be torn down. Belmont DESC will serve people earning 30% and 50% of Area Median Income who are experiencing chronic homelessness. DESC says its tenants usually earn about 9% to 12% of AMI. The Belmont building will feature only studio units and is being designed for single adult residents. Opposition to the project includes residents and building owners who say the area is already overburdened by the challenges around halfway houses and housing programs for at-risk populations. Broadway business owner and Republican candidate for mayor Rachael Savage made opposition to the plan an early foundation of her “Savage Citizens” campaign. “Capitol Hill already has over three hundred people housed in multiple buildings that operate on this model variously called Housing First, Permanent Supportive Housing or Low Barrier Housing,” Savage said “Our streets are in chaos. We have done enough.” Environmental appeals have become a regular aspect of the long delays faced by development projects around Seattle and, especially, in the city’s largest, most important decisions. CHS reported here as appeals including cases representing Madison Valley, Mount Baker, Hawthorne Hills, and “73 remaining Southern resident killer whales” have gummed up Seattle’s efforts to meet state zoning requirements and arrive at a new 20-year growth plan for the city. The Department of Ecology program, meanwhile, has already been at work in Seattle where a grant-boosted cleanup cleared the way for The Maddux, an affordable project from the Mt. Baker Housing organization just off Rainier. In 2018, the state awarded Mt. Baker Housing $400,000 to start assessing the cleanup project. The legislature later awarded another $6.2 million to finish the project. The cleanup began in June 2020 and took five months to complete. The corner had previously been home to a dry cleaner and gas station. An initial state report on the Stewart House site was completed in 2018. “The presence and/or condition of groundwater has not yet been assessed at the site,” the state’s updated reporting reads. The Department of Ecology is holding a hybrid in-person and virtual “open house” on the project on April 15th. Documents are available online here or in-person from the Capitol Hill library branch.

I’ve returned to better weather. Today, it’ll be sunny with a balmy high of 81. Temperatures will drop to the high 50s tonight before heating back up tomorrow. Expect a slight chance of rain Thursday into Thursday night. Friday should be a pleasant, partly cloudy day in the low- to mid-70s. Dead Heat: Katie Wilson and Bruce Harrell are statistically tied in the mayor’s race a week before the primary election. It’s a limited sample (651) with a 4.1 percent margin of error, but still, this race is not a cakewalk for Harrell. He’ll have to fight to break the curse of the one-term mayor. His campaign seems to be betting on making Wilson, a quite normal woman, out to be a society-restructuring radical (after all, Stalin also said Seattle pizza was too expensive). Those awkward TikToks might come in handy. Welcome Back? Debora Juarez is back in her old City Council seat for the next 16 months, replacing Cathy Moore after her resignation earlier this month. For recent transplants and the generally forgetful, Juarez used to be council president. Mexican American and a member of the Blackfeet Nation, Juarez was the first Indigenous person in that role. In a press release, Chief Seattle Club, Seattle Indian Health Board, Seattle Indian Services Commission, and United Indians of All Tribes Foundation celebrated her appointment. “Debora Juarez has long embodied the power, resilience, and vision of Indigenous leadership,” the release read. While charmingly foul-mouthed, Juarez is a conservative who fits right into the current brat pack. She’s also known for being somewhat unpredictable. It’s interesting that she applied for the vacancy—she made clear that she was tired of the job when she decided not to run for reelection in 2023—but since throwing her hat into the ring, her appointment has been expected. Juarez received 7 votes. Alexis Mercedes Rinck voted for Nilu Jenks, a former candidate for District 5. Ferg Down: Washington voters think Governor Bob Ferguson sucks. A Monday Cascade PBS/Elway poll found his approval rating at the sixth month mark is the lowest for a Washington Governor since 1993. Of the 403 registered voters surveyed, 32 percent consider Ferguson to be doing a “good” or “excellent” job. That’s eight points lower than Gov. Inslee, 11 points below Christine Gregoire, and 20 points below Gary Locke at the same point in their first terms. Almost the same percentage of people (31 percent) think he’s doing a “poor” job; 22 percent rated his job performance as “fair.” Damn, dude. According to Cascade, people are angry that Ferguson is signing off on new taxes, that he’s cut spending, that he’s too focused on President Donald Trump’s administration, that he’s not focused enough on Trump, that he’s too in line with Democrats, and that he’s too moderate. You can’t please everyone all of the time, but Ferguson’s middling centerism seems to please nobody. Now to HMW for the latest on Denny Blaine. Thanks For Nothing: The City submitted its “abatement plan” for Denny Blaine Park on Monday evening. No one is thrilled about its idea to divide the already small beach into a nude area (closest to the water) and a clothed area (the vast majority of the park). “Zoning” Denny Blaine isn’t a new idea. Last year, the Parks Department proposed a nudity DMZ at the parking lot—much further back than the current abatement plan. When it was submitted for public comment, beach goers roundly rejected it because they felt it made a concession to neighbors they didn’t have to make. (This is where we remind you, dear reader, for the hundredth time, that nudity is legal in Seattle.) The city is also planning to increase the presence of park rangers and signage to the park. Sophie Amity Debs, who co-runs the park stewardship group Friends of Denny Blaine, told The Stranger that by cutting the space down to a tiny sliver of the park, the city is “not setting themselves up for success with having people respect and take these guidelines seriously.” This proposal isn’t the worst case scenario. “We are glad that it doesn't just outright ban nudity, because that was one of our big fears … and we are also glad that the enforcement mechanisms are via park rangers and not by SPD.” Back to me :)! Firefighters Saving a Rainforest: The human-caused Bear Gulch fire (first reported July 6, wonder how that started?) is creeping toward the Staircase area of Olympic National Park. The 1,100 acre fire is only 10 percent contained, the Seattle Times reports. Two hundred people, including firefighters, are assigned to this fire. Big Beautiful Electric Bills? Lawmakers say the cuts to renewable energy in President Donald Trump's Beautiful Bill will raise the price of electricity in Washington. As it turns out, massive public infrastructure projects are not optional or spontaneous. They’re important and planned decades in advance. Cities are growing, transmission lines are aging, and AI data centers are siphoning off our excess power to animate photos of dead grandparents at a time heatwaves are more likely to hit California and Washington simultaneously. We can’t just pause this work, cross our fingers and hope the power stays on. We’ll still have to pay for repairs, new energy projects, and extra power with our money. Seattle City Light CEO Dawn Lindell says people “can expect to see significant rate increases for probably the next 10 to 12 years.” The US Department of Energy did not respond to KUOW’s request for comment. Suspect Arrested For Shooting Lummi Nation Officer: Authorities arrested the 26-year-old suspect and Whatcom county resident for investigation of attempted murder yesterday afternoon. Early Monday morning, the officer responded to a call for a vehicle in a ditch in Lummi Nation west of Bellingham. The driver shot the officer and fled on foot. It’s unclear where and how the suspect was apprehended, but multiple law enforcement agencies were involved in the search. The officer was rushed into surgery. As of Monday afternoon, the officer was alive and receiving medical care. Northgate Shooter: Police say they're still searching for two suspects they say shot a man in the back of the head outside the Northgate Transit Center on Monday morning. The victim, 48, was in critical condition as of Monday afternoon. Over 60,000 Killed in Gaza Since October 7: Gaza’s ministry of health puts the total at 60,034. At least 62 have been killed since dawn, reports Al Jazeera, 19 of them aid seekers. Yesterday, two of the most-known Israeli rights groups (B’Tselem and Physicians for Human Rights —Israel) called the genocide a genocide for the first time. This morning, the UK announced that it would recognize a Palestinian state if Israel doesn't reach a ceasefire with Hamas by September. Shooter Killed Four in Midtown Manhattan: After much unverified online speculation that gunman Shane Tamura had targeted the investment company Blackstone, police say the three-page note found in his wallet indicates Tamura had likely targeted NFL headquarters. Police say Tamura claimed he suffered from CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, from playing football and accused the NFL of concealing the danger to players. Tamura shot himself in the chest. “Study my brain please,” police say he wrote. “I’m sorry.” CTE is a serious condition that increases the risk of suicide. It can only be diagnosed in an autopsy. One study of 2,000 former NFL players published in JAMA Neurology found 1 in 3 believed they had CTE. FIGHT! Paul Dans, a chief architect of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025, is challenging Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican party’s most eligible bachelor. Dans, who looks like something bad happened to Mark Cuban (the Portrait of Mark Cuban?), is expected to formally announce his campaign in Charleston this Wednesday. Chris LaCivita, advisor to Sen. Graham’s campaign and co-manager of Trump’s presidential bid, ominously told the AP that Dans’ campaign would “end prematurely.” Thanks, Chris. Strange and threatening! Not Even Capitalism Safe From ICE Raids: The New York Times reports that work has slowed to a crawl at one Omaha, Nebraska meatpacking plant. Three weeks after ICE came to Glenn Valley Foods with a battering ram and a warrant for 107 workers, production is down by 70%. Half of the maintenance crew is being deported. About 50 workers are in ICE detention. Owner Gary Rohwer told the Times it was a “wipeout.” We don’t need the lens of capitalism to grasp the injustice of ICE abductions, but the bottom line is often the only thing that reaches Americans. *SCREECH*: Two whistleblowers have accused Emil Bove, former defense attorney for President Donald Trump, current top official at the Justice Department, and nominee for the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals, of directing Justice Department staff to ignore federal court orders in the way of Trump’s mass deportation plans. A third says he lied to Senators during his confirmation hearing last month. The Senate is expected to vote on his appointment this week. A Tune for You: Thanks, MJ Lenderman. I love to do dishes to your music. Editor's Note: A previous version of this article said that people had speculated that the shooter in Manhattan had targeted Blackrock in the Midtown building.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/06/27/80120394/progressive-revenue-is-not-dead-in-seattle,The Stranger,Progressive Revenue Is Not Dead in Seattle Just Can't Get Enough?,"Seattle electeds have finally realized that they can’t simply rely on the Jumpstart Tax, a progressive (but fluctuating) payroll tax, to backfill budget shortfalls in perpetuity, and they are pursuing new progressive revenue options. I know, I know, this city council and this mayor finding new revenue methods? Our financial outlook is that bad. The Seattle Shield Initiative united an odd duo, Council Member Alexis Mercedes Rinck and Mayor Bruce Harrell. Together, they proposed the initiative to help alleviate the financial stress that a $251 million deficit across all fund balances—and Trump in the White House—will put on the city. The initiative will temporarily raise business and occupation (B&O) taxes to fund programs threatened by the Donald Trump administration, such as investments in housing vouchers, shelters, food and nutrition access, resources for survivors of gender-based violence, and affordable housing. But it gets better. The initiative doesn’t raise the B&O tax for all businesses, only some. Under the initiative, to help bolster struggling mom and pop shops, many small businesses will actually stop paying B&O tax. Sounds pretty good, right? Not if you’re part of a big business organization. The Downtown Seattle Association (DSA, but not the cool one) and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce have already poo-poo’d the proposed initiative. Jon Scholes, president and CEO of the DSA (derogatory) and frequent bad-opinion columnist at the Seattle Times, said in a statement that the Trump tariffs are already bad for business and city leaders are about to “make things worse on local companies” with this new tax. “This proposal is a tax on downtown Seattle’s revitalization and a self-inflicted wound to the progress we’ve been making to attract more businesses downtown and strengthen the city’s tax base. It will make it harder to fill empty tall office buildings and storefronts with companies, which will threaten the commercial tax base and shift more of the tax burden to residents,” Scholes wrote. The Seattle Shield Initiative will raise the B&O tax threshold exemption from $100,000 to $2,000,000 in gross revenue, which means 76 percent of small businesses won’t pay any B&O tax at all. Meanwhile, only businesses earning more than $2 million in revenue will have to pay a higher tax than they did before. According to a press release from the city, “approximately 90% of businesses would owe less than they do today.” Of course, that means those high-earners would shoulder the B&O tax. This is unfair, according to Scholes. “City leaders should heed the lessons from the past and reject boneheaded ideas solely concocted in the name of fighting President Trump,” Scholes wrote. “This rushed tax proposal is bad fiscal policy that will set Seattle back and raise costs for residents.” He had some big, weird feelings (“It’s the fiscal policy version of Seattle’s defund the police movement and if passed will ultimately result in Seattle defunding its tax base,” he wrote on LinkedIn. “This idea should be thrown in the trash bin next to the remnants of defund the police, CHOP/CHAZ, legalizing drugs, etc”) and I’m sure we’ll hear more from him in a forthcoming Seattle Times editorial. But, I must say, this is pretty funny outrage coming from the organization that just pushed policy through the Seattle City Council to put eyesore digital advertising kiosks on Seattle streets. The money earned from those kiosks will go right back into DSA coffers. Maybe they can use some of that money to help their struggling big businesses pay the B&O tax increase. In response to these comments, at a press conference, Harrell said, “We think it’s good policy, and we would disagree [with the DSA].” Remember, this is from longtime DSA (again, not the socialist one) ally Harrell. Do we… gotta hand it to him? “We are not trying to run business out of Seattle, we are open for business,” Harrell, newly anointed fan of progressive revenue (or just a man worried about being another one-term mayor), continued. “So as we look at dealing with a $250 million deficit… The fact is that the state legislature only gives us so many tools, and this is a tool we think along the lines of progressive revenue that is a smart policy to adopt...We will do everything possible to continue to have a healthy business environment, but we stand behind this policy.” In a statement to The Stranger, Mercedes Rinck said, ""It’s true. This proposal progressively shifts B&O tax burden to the largest businesses in Seattle. The top 10 percent will pay more, and the bottom and middle will pay less. I think we can all see that as a worthwhile investment in the local community, workforce, and economy. What will actually set Seattle back is doing nothing while thousands in our community are on the brink of food insecurity and homelessness due to draconian federal cuts."" Wealthy business owner gripes aside, this initiative is a boon for small businesses, according to Jeanie Chunn, community activist, longtime small business advocate, and current candidate for City Council District 2. Chunn, who helped engage small business owners on this initiative for Rinck's office, described how paying fewer B&O taxes will make a huge difference. Especially for businesses operating on the margins like restaurants, having extra funds could pay for much-needed new equipment, new benefits for employees, or repairs. The initiative will provide “much welcomed relief,” she wrote in an email. According to Chunn, most restaurants fall under the $2 million revenue threshold. Even for those who rake in over $2 million annually, they’ll still pay less in local B&O taxes than they do currently because “it's only on sales over $2M.” The Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce jumped to its usual excuses for the reasons we can’t raise taxes: It has some “interesting ideas,” but it’s “rushed,” and companies just can’t afford it right now. “I think the Chamber of Commerce's outrage over this initiative shows that they have and will always represent the interests of large corporations and not locally-owned businesses, small business owners, or the workers of Seattle,” Chunn wrote. ""If the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce only wants to advocate for the preferences of their Emerald and Platinum members, that is their prerogative,"" Mercedes Rinck told The Stranger. ""Local government has responsibility to step up in this moment, and our proposal gives Seattle residents that choice."" However, the Seattle Shield Initiative is not law yet. Rinck will need to curry favor with the other members of the council. They will have to vote on the initiative by Aug. 5. If it's approved, we the people will get to have our say in the November election.

It was a close one. The department reported 84 successful hires in 2024 — one more officer than it lost. Monday, Mayor Bruce Harrell and city officials held a press conference with a bolder mood as officials say SPD’s hiring momentum has continued with 60 officers hired here through April: The 60 officers hired so far in 2025 are more than in the last three years at this point combined. This includes experienced officers who can get started working sooner, with as many lateral hires in 2025 as in the previous five years at this point combined, and as many re-hires as in the last three years combined. Separations are also below the last five years through mid-April. If current trends continue, SPD is on track to hire over 150 officers in 2025, which would be the largest total hires in any year in recent record. Harrell and new SPD Chief Shon Barnes said Monday that the hiring comes on the back of a continued influx of candidates with the department receiving 1,218 officer applications by the end of the first quarter this year, compared to 690 applications at that point in 2024. Harrell, in the early stages of his reelection campaign to keep his office at City Hall, placed the quarter year’s hiring turnaround in context of his administration’s efforts to reform the department and grow efforts like the city’s new Community Assisted Response & Engagement CARE crisis responders while also pushing back on cutbacks or downsizing of SPD despite growing budget gaps and revenue uncertainty for the city. “A well-staffed and well-trained police department is essential to effective public safety in Seattle,” Harrell said. “Our work to modernize recruiting and increase qualified applications is showing results through record hiring in 2025 – putting us on a path to restore Seattle Police Department staffing,” The mayor and City Council president Sara Nelson, also facing reelection, have pushed for a goal of growing SPD’s ranks from the just under 1,000 officers on patrol in 2022 to nearly 1,500 by 2027. CHS reported here on the hiring of former Madison, Wisconsin chief Barnes to lead SPD and his focus on recruitment and retention at the department though large initiatives and smaller issues like infrastructure investments to improve the work environment including smaller upgrades like new carpet and fresh paint. The signs of a turnaround come as Seattle Police officials late last year said the department’s ranks had fallen to the lowest numbers in 30 years as the Seattle City Council expanded a program that pays out a $7,500 hiring bonus to new recruits and boosts bonuses for so-called “lateral” hiring from other police departments to $50,000 as the Harrell administration said Seattle continues to face regional competition for officers. SPD also launched a new recruiting advertising campaign this summer featuring “cartoon versions of police officers in various heroic scenarios.” The campaign is part of a $2.5 million budget in 2025 for police recruitment advertising and marketing. The department has also vowed to improve its recruitment of women even as the city faces ongoing harassment litigation from the department under ousted Chief Adrian Diaz. Publicola reported this week on SPD’s struggles despite its commitment to the “30 by 30” pledge calling for a 30% female recruit class by 2030. Publicola reports that only five of the 60 new hires touted by Harrell Monday are women. Paying cops more is helping. Seattle ranked 29th in the region to start 2024 for base pay for its new recruits an issue the bonus program won’t address. The city and the Seattle Police Officers Guild arrived at a new contract last spring that boosted pay 23%. The city says new recruits now start at a $103,000 a year salary with a $7,500 hiring incentive, and qualified lateral transfers from another agency start at $116,000 with a $50,000 incentive. SPD also says its “average hiring process for police officer candidates” has been streamlined from 5-9 months to 3-5 months. “On average, it takes about a year after graduating from the academy for recruits to become a Seattle Police Officer working an assigned patrol beat,” the city’s report on the hiring success said. Police officer candidates must be at least 20.5 years of age, have a high school diploma or GED equivalent, be generally physically fit, and be able to obtain a Washington driver’s license. There is no upper age limit to apply. In 2023, a 62-year-old joined the force. Monday, officials pointed at citywide crime totals that they say show encouraging public safety trends. CHS reported this month on those totals for the East Precinct that showed Capitol Hill and the Central District have been left out of the rest of city’s dip in reported property crime. East Precinct Violent Crime Report Totals East Precinct Property Crime Report Totals To start 2025 as he begins his campaign for a second term leading the city, Harrell has held up the turnaround in hiring as a key accomplishment of his administration. So far, Harrell’s most significant political challenge has emerged from his political left where progressive activist Katie Wilson is building her campaign around her work leading the Transit Riders Union and minimum wage and renter rights campaigns around the region.

The latest update comes after last year’s 84 hires as SPD eked out a small victory by bringing on one more officer than it reported losing. The press release from the mayor’s office touts the hundred-hire milestone but doesn’t include statistics on the department’s current ranks. CHS reported here in April as Harrell and new SPD Chief Shon Barnes said that improved hiring totals were being driven by an influx of candidates with the department receiving 1,218 officer applications by the end of the first quarter this year, compared to 690 applications at that point in 2024. The city’s data shows that applications fell slightly in the second quarter to just under 12 qualified applicants per day. The signs of a turnaround have continued as Seattle Police officials late last year said the department’s ranks had fallen to the lowest numbers in 30 years as the Seattle City Council expanded a program that pays out a $7,500 hiring bonus to new recruits and boosts bonuses for so-called “lateral” hiring from other police departments to $50,000 as the Harrell administration said Seattle continues to face regional competition for officers. SPD also launched a new recruiting advertising campaign this summer featuring “cartoon versions of police officers in various heroic scenarios.” The campaign is part of a $2.5 million budget in 2025 for police recruitment advertising and marketing. The department has also vowed to improve its recruitment of women even as the city faces ongoing harassment litigation from the department under ousted Chief Adrian Diaz. The starting salary for a SPD officer is now $103,000 for entry level recruits and $116,000 for lateral officers, Harrell’s office says. The mayor and City Council president Sara Nelson, also facing reelection, have pushed for a goal of growing SPD’s ranks from the just under 1,000 officers on patrol in 2022 to nearly 1,500 by 2027. Barnes, meanwhile, is holding a series of public safety community forums this summer. A date for a District 3 forum for neighborhoods including Capitol Hill, First Hill, and the Central District has not yet been announced. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/02/12/79918008/legislative-sausage-making-at-its-finest-spds-blast-balls-are-back,The Stranger,“Legislative sausage-making at its finest”: SPD’s Blast Balls are Back Just Can't Get Enough?,"Yesterday, the City Council voted six to three to reinstate the Seattle Police Department’s ability to use blast balls, a controversial “less lethal” form of crowd control, on protestors. Mayor Bruce Harrell’s office introduced the bill in October 2024. Councilmembers Cathy Moore, Alexis Mercedes Rinck, and Joy Hollingsworth opposed it, while Council President Sara Nelson and Councilmembers Maritza Rivera, Rob Saka, Mark Solomon, Dan Strauss, and Bob Kettle voted in favor. The use of blast balls was banned by their predecessors in June 2020, in response to the brutal consequences of their use on protestors against police brutality that same summer. However, that ban was never really upheld. Instead, it was put on hold by U.S. District Judge James Robart, who oversees the federal consent decree that the Seattle Police Department has been operating under since 2012. At the time, the Department of Justice and then-SPD Chief Carmen Best argued that not having “less lethal” options would force police to use, uh, more lethal options. “Christina Fogg, an Assistant U.S. Attorney, argued on Friday that without blast balls, pepper spray and other weapons banned by the Council, police would have only ‘batons, tasers and handguns,’” wrote the Seattle Times’ David Gutman, in an article on Robart’s order to block the ban. Robart’s basically said, “Yeah, totally,” instead of what a normal person would say, which is: “Why the fuck would you shoot someone who is unarmed and exercising their First Amendment right to protest, even if they were about to smash a window or sock a cop? Why would you even suggest that!?” And perhaps even: “With that attitude, why the hell do we allow you absolute psychopaths to carry deadly weapons?” A quite frankly upsetting number of sitting councilmembers were also in the, “Yeah, totally,” camp yesterday, but I suppose that’s to be expected these days. Anyway, I won’t bore you with the wonky details, but basically the ban got trapped in legal limbo and never actually took effect. All this time, we’ve been operating under SPD’s existing interim crowd control policies. Indeed, the vote yesterday had a lot to do with getting out from under the consent decree, as nailing down a permanent crowd control policy was one of Robart’s last asks. Given that Mayor Bruce Harrell has made it abundantly clear that he wants to see the consent decree lifted during his time in office, and given the close political alignment he enjoys with the majority of the council, this was pretty much always going to pass. Weirdly, Councilmember Cathy Moore, who shares plenty of politics with Harrell, joined with Councilmember Alexis Mercedes Rinck —who shares politics with precisely none of her colleagues or the mayor— to oppose the bill in its current form. Both spoke to its flaws, and both offered amendments attempting to soften the blow. “I understand the need to move us out of the consent decree, I absolutely support the need to get out of the consent decree, but as I said the first time, we have to get it right,” Moore said. “And I don’t know that the court is necessarily going to believe or find that this is an adequate policy. It’s deeply flawed.” Be that as it may, it’s just that SPD hasn’t had the opportunity, motivation, or explicit permission from the council to use them. Now they do. The important question is, will they? Based on a close read of the new ordinance, there’s no way of knowing. The big takeaway here is that this new “regulation” does very little to actually regulate the behavior of cops when it comes to blast balls, tear gas, pepper spray, and so on. While the bill is packed with very serious-sounding regulations— including a rock-solid, totally enforceable pinky promise, “police use of force for crowd control shall be objectively reasonable, necessary, and proportional to the threat presented” — at the end of the day, when and how to use these incredibly dangerous “less lethal” weapons is left almost entirely up to SPD. Better yet, a lot of it has to do with what an officer thinks is happening from moment to moment. Generally, an SPD Incident Commander or supervisor may still approve anything besides blast balls and tear gas. Once approved, officers must not deploy said tools “unless specific facts and circumstances are occurring or about to occur that create an imminent risk of physical injury to any person or significant property damage.” Nothing further on what those specific facts and circumstances are is included in the bill. For tear gas specifically, the new crowd control bill prohibits it except in situations essentially amounting to a riot (the definition of which is a whole nebula of its own) or a hostage scenario and requires a Mayoral proclamation of civil emergency. As for blast balls, they also carry the same Mayoral proclamation requirement, though they can be used for regular old crowd control, provided, of course, that “specific facts and circumstances establish an imminent threat of violence against persons or significant property damage.” Cops are already supposed to reserve force, and especially deadly force for only situations where it is absolutely necessary, typically in response to immediate threats to their own or a victim’s life. Sounds great, but if their colleagues in Minnesota did that, SPD wouldn’t have had a reason to deploy all the blast balls they deployed in 2020 in the first place. God’s green internet wouldn’t be riddled with videos of innocent people getting shot in the back, beaten to death while they scream for their mother, or lit up while crawling along the ground on their stomach, hands clearly in view. The issue with so much of our regulation around policing is that we’re trusting people who have demonstrated incredibly poor judgment to make important, life-or-death judgment calls. During public comment, Matt Offenbacher, who described himself as a Capitol Hill resident and SODO business owner, brought up the cautionary tale of Captain Steve Strand. “Among other things, he drove his unmarked police car into a crowd of nonviolent climate protestors,” Offenbacher said. “I was one of those protestors, so I can tell you firsthand how shockingly unhinged Captain Strand’s behavior seemed. From the moment he arrived on the scene, his rage led him to escalate his response, greatly increasing the potential for harm and injury.” Noting that his final words from above were not his own opinion, but the actual findings of the Office of Police Accountability, Offenbacher concluded by saying, “I bring Captain Strand to your attention today as a warning that no matter what policies and safeguards you write, councilmembers, if you reauthorize the SPD’s use of less lethal weapons, they will use them and there will be a certain number of officers who, in the heat of the moment, will let their own feelings, their politics, their rage dictate their actions.” Kettle, the bill’s sponsor, later said that “training, training, training” would be key to reincorporating less lethal weaponry in a way that doesn’t harm innocent Seattleites — a handwave if I’ve ever heard one. We have yet to train our way out of what I consider to be the root cause of the rage Offenbacher highlighted, which is that too many police officers see the people they’re supposed to be protecting and serving during protests — the protestors, to be clear, along with everyone else in the vicinity — as the enemy. While I realize this echoes a popular protest slogan, it’s also concerning that so many of the statutes in this “less lethal” weapons policy use imminent property damage as a trigger for the deployment of pretty serious levels of force. Sure, if someone is visibly attempting to maim or kill someone else, and you can prevent it by tossing a blast ball under their feet, I can see an argument for that. But for fuck’s sake, if you’re debating the merits of whether cops should be allowed to cause severe harm and long-term psychological damage to a person — plus all the people around that person — over a plate glass window, what are you even doing on that dias? Perhaps the one thing in this ordinance that could have provided a hard consequence for making the wrong judgment call was Rinck’s Amendment I, which would have created a private right of action to the tune of $10,000 in the event of injury resulting from improper use of blast balls. That right would be denied to anyone who “in the judgment of a reasonable officer, commits a criminal offense at or immediately prior to the use of less lethal force.” Kettle, the bill’s sponsor, was not sold on the idea. “One of the things on this is that there’s already processes available to individuals who felt that they’ve been injured by anybody in the city, nevermind the Seattle Police Department,” he said, “Those processes get the job done, and we should not add to that with this private right of action.” He’s partially right. The city already had to pay $10 million to people injured by less lethal weapons during the 2020 protests. Not that that did anything to steer cops away from such tools. At a Feb. 8 anti-Trump protest on Alki Beach, officers threatened to tear gas and pepper spray protestors who had blocked Alki Ave. Whether or not you believe additional financial penalties would put cops on their best behavior, the amendment went down in flames, with only Rinck and Moore voting in favor. Moore did secure a couple of small concessions. Amendment E added a new recital basically putting down on record that blast balls have a “demonstrated track record” of hurting people who were doing nothing wrong. Amendment D ended up being the only specific, tangible restriction on the use of blast balls, mandating that they only be thrown underhand and away from people, even if it did still include a carveout allowing officers to “deploy blast balls overhand and near a person” so long as they deemed it “reasonable, necessary, and proportional to address immediate threats to life safety.” Silver linings aside, what we are left with is a bill that gives our extremely cop-friendly mayor control over when and how cops are allowed to quell unrest. But once he’s decided a protest is fair game and declared a state of emergency, it’s entirely up to the cops to decide when it’s appropriate to employ “less lethal” weapons. Do not be fooled, nothing in this bill prevents them from doing what they did last time around: shooting first and covering ass later. All they have to do is say that someone was about to do something very bad, an excuse cops have definitely never used to get away with bullshit before. As has become so common under the current Mayor and Council, we have endured yet another situation where people in power quibble on and on and on about something that is ultimately symbolic, with the resulting vote giving SPOG and/or the Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce something damn close to whatever they asked for in the beginning. Or, as Saka put it in his closing remarks, “legislative sausage-making at its finest.” I think I’m full.",,"['mayor', 'mayoral', 'city council', 'councilmember', 'police', 'SPD', 'policy', 'ordinance', 'SPD (title)']",19.0,2025-08-01T13:51:03.803671,11070

Challenger Katie Wilson seems to have a top-two result all but wrapped up. “This woman is so smart, she’s kicked my ass so many times in so many debates,” repeat mayoral candidate Joe Mallahan said Tuesday night during a candidates forum focused on District 3 issues organized by the Leschi Community Council, the Central Area Neighborhood District Council, and the Coalition of Immigrants Refugees and Communities of Color. Mallahan’s admission — he’s currently running third in fundraising in the race with $122,000 in campaign contributions plus another $15,000 from an independent expenditure committee — made it pretty clear he knows Wilson is going through to November’s General Election. Wilson and incumbent Bruce Harrell’s campaigns have both reported raising around $450,000 each. Harrell is also backed by a $200,000 “Bruce Harrell 4 SeattlesFuture” independent expenditure committee. “We have great values here in Seattle but we often fail to live up to them,” Wilson said Tuesday night in her pitch to the crowd inside Leschi’s Grace United Methodist Church as she positioned her leadership as a collaborative and active effort to push beyond current City Hall leadership’s moderate leanings. Wilson promised an administration that would be more aggressive in galvanizing the city against federal cutbacks and attacks on DEI programs. She said she would back efforts to civilianize more of the work currently saddling the Seattle Police Department, expand alternative responses like the CARE crisis responders, and fix the city’s “broken” police accountability system. And she said she would lead in unity with the city’s community organizations and labor unions — “I’m a believer in the power of organization,” Wilson said. The progressive organizer who is the executive directors of the Transit Riders Union and helped lead minimum wage and renter rights campaigns around the region won the endorsement of the 43rd District Democrats last month. Tuesday night, Harrell “had another appointment and couldn’t move his schedule,” forum organizers told the crowd. In 2021’s primary, voters in Leschi and this area of the city were strong supporters of the Central District born and raised candidate. Harrell’s absence might have been to his advantage. The mayor did not have to respond to the role former T-Mobile executive Mallahan has settled into of Harrell basher with hopes of somehow henpecking the incumbent into third place and out of the race. “I believe the city of Seattle is badly mismanaged,” the repeat mayoral candidate said during one of his times at the microphone, calling Harrell a “disrespectful, vindictive, finger-pointer of a mayor.” You can watch the full candidates forum here.

CHS first reported on the plan in December as Deputy Mayor Tim Burgess included the proposal during a public safety meeting with the neighborhood’s business community sparked by ongoing challenges around street crime and drug use around the Broadway-Pike/Pine core and Cal Anderson Park. Last week in a press conference to tout the success of SPD’s Real Time Crime Center, Harrell’s office said the mayor backs an expansion of a pilot program that already has cameras along Aurora Ave, 3rd Ave, and in the International District to include areas around Cal Anderson and Pike/Pine. The mayor’s office is also backing expansion of the 24×7 surveillance program to include the area around Garfield High School where the city and the district are spending thousands on security upgrades and community services to counter deadly gun violence that has marred the campus. Garfield is also being considered for a pilot program beginning this fall that would pay for a Seattle Police School Engagement Officer on the campus. The Harrell administration says it recently proposed legislation to the Seattle City Council that would expand “the geographic areas where City CCTV cameras can be installed, including public streets and sidewalks around Garfield and Nova High Schools, the Capitol Hill Nightlife District, and the SODO Stadium Area,” according to a statement from City Hall. “The legislation also authorizes the RTCC to view and record SDOT traffic cameras at select intersections and along major arterial roads in the city,” the mayor’s office adds. (Image: City of Seattle) The proposed expansion comes as Harrell and new SPD Chief Shon Barnes touted the early success of the RTCC and the pilot creating the new SPD surveillance system combining Closed-Circuit Television Camera systems above the city’s streets with “real-time crime center” software.after only two months of operation. The city says the new system “integrates various video and data streams for enhanced analysis and investigation of crime incidents.” Since its launch on May 20, the upgraded center has played a role in investigating 600 reported incidents and was currently supporting 90 active criminal investigations, officials said last week. According to the city, RTCC analysts provide patrol officers and detectives with incident details, video images, and other relevant information, “often as incidents are happening.” “RTCC analysts can communicate directly with officers in the field via police radio channels,” the city says. “During a recent gun violence incident near Aurora Avenue North, RTCC analysts used CCTV cameras to observe the shooting suspect, send an image of the suspect to responding patrol officers, and then advise officers of the escape route that the offender was taking.” SPD first rolled out the RTCC in 2015 funded through a $411,000 Department of Justice grant. The mayor hasn’t put a public price tag on the new upgraded capabilities of Seattle’s RTCC or the proposed surveillance camera expansions. The addition of the initial set of Aurora, 3rd Ave, and ID cameras was reported as $1.8 million. “Our Real Time Crime Center is already proving to be a vital tool in solving crimes and improving public safety across the city, supporting hundreds of investigations and accountability for dangerous offenders,” Harrell said in a statement. “By investing in and leveraging evidence-based technology, we’re giving our officers the resources they need to respond effectively while ensuring these tools are used responsibly and with strong safeguards. Public safety remains our top priority, and this initiative shows our commitment to creating safer neighborhoods for everyone in Seattle.” “Our Real Time Crime Center is already proving to be a vital tool in solving crimes and improving public safety across the city, supporting hundreds of investigations and accountability for dangerous offenders,” said Mayor Harrell. “By investing in and leveraging evidence-based technology, we’re giving our officers the resources they need to respond effectively while ensuring these tools are used responsibly and with strong safeguards. Public safety remains our top priority, and this initiative shows our commitment to creating safer neighborhoods for everyone in Seattle.” In the East Precinct, SPD has focused on drug issues and street disorder centered around Pike and Broadway and the area around Cal Anderson and Deputy Mayor Burgess’s renewed efforts sparked by neighborhood outcry — and a key email from a neighborhood developer — over an October murder on 11th Ave. (Image: City of Seattle) Burgess said earlier this year his office was working on a plan to add the area around Cal Anderson and Pike/Pine identified by SPD as a trouble zone for drug crimes and street disorder to the anti-crime camera system pilot being rolled out in the area around Aurora Ave N, the International District including Little Saigon, and the 3rd Ave corridor downtown. Other City Hall initiatives including one of its biggest haven’t made much of an impact. CHS reported here on the so far rarely used Capitol Hill Stay Out of Drug Area and the first recipient of a banishment order for the zone. Meanwhile, in the Central District, the 2024/2025 school year at Garfield High School began with new efforts around gun concerns at the 23rd Ave campus and across the city as Seattle officials led by Harrell announced a $14.5 million plan focused on intervention, mental health, and increased use of “school-based safety specialist” private security guards following the deadly lunchtime shooting of teen Amarr Murphy-Paine in June 2024 in the Garfield campus parking lot. The timeline for expanding the cameras to Pike/Pine and 23rd Ave is not clear as chair Bob Kettle must now move the legislation forward with the council’s public safety committee. Harrell, meanwhile, is engaged in a closer than expected race with challenger Katie Wilson as the August 5th primary approaches. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

Mayor Bruce Harrell’s office is explaining away his comments praising Elon Musk and other MAGA-aligned tech leaders last week while addressing the city’s business community at the annual “State of Downtown” gathering. “The mayor was not praising them, he was referencing they have an objective reputation as leaders in technology and innovation, and that it is a danger they are in the president’s orbit,” the mayor’s spokesperson told Publicola trying to explain the praise. “We know that our current president surrounds himself by some of the smartest innovators around,” Harrell said as he veered off script in his business-friendly speech at the Downtown Seattle Association event. “When we drop names like Andreessen or Peter Thiel or David Sacks or Elon Musk, these are smart innovators.” The nuanced praise for Musk in the shadow of his Department of Government Efficiency work to gut major areas of the federal government and his increased efforts supporting right wing campaigns around the globe comes as Harrell is shaping his reelection campaign with themes around “common values,” “public safety solutions,” and “proven leadership to stand up for our values.” With his job going up for a vote, the veteran Seattle politician does not seem interested at this point in engaging in extra tangles with the Trump administration — though his office said the mayor “certainly doesn’t agree with their politics” in the statement provided to media in the wake of last week’s Downtown Seattle Association speech. It will be a tricky row to hoe for Seattle leaders facing reelection in 2025. Monday morning, City Attorney Ann Davison, who ran for Lt. Governor as a Republican in 2020, released a statement calling Seattle a “Welcoming City,” avoiding the “Sanctuary City” label championed in past battles with Trump over immigration, as she announced Seattle will join San Francisco, Portland, “and many other jurisdictions across the country” in filing suit against the Trump administration over its threats to cut to cut federal resources to cities “that do not conduct federal immigration enforcement.” “It is not against the law to be a welcoming city. For more than 20 years, the City of Seattle, by ordinance, has directed its employees to not inquire about a person’s immigration status, absent a legal obligation to do so,” the Davison statement reads. “It is well within our authority to direct our employees in this manner.” Davison announced in January she would seek reelection joining public safety collaborators Harrell and City Council president Sara Nelson on the Seattle campaign trail. In the mayor’s race, meanwhile, none of the candidates lining up to oppose Harrell at this point have the mayor’s name recognition but one of them is being very straightforward in their approach to Making America Great Again. “Calling all MAGA Republicans in WA State. We need your help from outside the blue city,” Harrell challenger and Capitol Hill shop owner Rachael Savage pleaded on social media this week seeking financial support for her campaign. CHS reported here on Savage’s campaign launch as a Republican for the non-partisan mayor’s office as the candidate is promising to lead an end to “the addiction and mental illness epidemic” with a major crackdown in which the city’s police and prosecutors “arrest, charge and convict every person committing crimes on the streets of Seattle no matter how small those crimes are.” $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

Mayor Bruce Harrell has issued an executive order “Supporting and Expediting Sound Transit 3 Investments in the City of Seattle” hoped to help speed construction of new light rail connections to Ballard and West Seattle. Harrell, fresh off the annual “state of the city” address in which he put forward a raft of urbanist and growth initiatives to join his continued messages around addressing public safety and downtown business concerns as he seeks reelection, said his office “will lead the development of and transmit to the City Council legislation to streamline the permit process for this major project,” saying the city will consider “land use code changes, formal adoption of ST3 projects, and supportive property transactions” to “speed up light rail delivery” of the highly anticipated new connections. Let’s check in with the locals. “It still is short on actual details of what kind of zoning changes will be proposed, among other things, saying only ‘In 2025 and 2026, my administration will develop several bodies of legislation, including land use code amendments, formal adoption of the ST3 projects, and necessary real property transactions to allow the projects to proceed as quickly as possible,'” the West Seattle Blog reports, adding that the order “also says that while there’s currently a team with 20 full-time city employees focused on ST3 (the ballot measure that included the West Seattle/Ballard extensions), that will be multiplied.” My Ballard focuses on the money. “To keep the project on track, the City is allocating $5.2 million in 2025 and $6.8 million in 2026 to hire up to 50 additional staff members to focus on design, permitting, construction, and station planning,” My Ballard reports. “The expanded office will also create a four-year plan to ensure safe, accessible stations with thoughtful design, improved access routes, safety measures, and equitable development around transit hubs.” The current timeline calls for the nearly 8 mile light rail extension to Ballard to open by 2039. My Ballard says it will include nine new stations, in addition the needed second downtown transit tunnel, and a Salmon Bay crossing. The West Seattle link will be half as long and is currently planned to be fully delivered by 2032. It is projected to cost between $6.7 and $7.1 billion. The Ballard extension? It is forecasted to cost more than $11 billion. Both extensions were part of the $53.8 billion Sound Transit 3 tax package approved by voters in 2016. Meanwhile, testing efforts — and frequent service disruptions — continue as Sound Transit prepares to open Judkins Park Station and the complete 2 Line light rail system connecting Seattle and the Eastside via I-90 by “late” 2025. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

KUOW reported new details this week from a 1996 incident where the then 37-year-old lawyer working in Nebraska pulled a gun on a man and a woman in a dispute over a parking spot at an Iowa casino. “We was like, ‘What the hell is going on?!” the woman, who was eight months pregnant at the time, told KUOW recalling the incident 30 years later. “It scared us.” KUOW broke the story on Harrell’s 1996 arrest in February but the new reporting provides perspective from the couple on other end of the dispute and details how the case was dismissed and never addressed as Harrell rose at City Hall as a member of the city council and then Seattle’s mayor. The small incident made news at the time, KUOW reports, because Harrell had been appointed to a housing authority board in Omaha. Harrell admitted to “displaying a gun” but said it was because of death threats he received after the appointment. After he was arrested and booked in the gun incident, KUOW says Harrell removed his name for consideration for the board. The case, however, was eventually dropped. Harrell’s spokesperson told KUOW this week the mayor was the victim. “In some ways, this was an introduction to the hostilities the mayor would receive as a public servant, and reminiscent of the treatment and bigotry he has received throughout his life as a biracial person by people of all races and backgrounds who see him as different,” the spokesperson told KUOW. The spokesperson told KUOW Harrell hired a law firm in 1996 “to write to the casino that Harrell’s constitutional rights were violated because of ‘unreasonable search and seizures based on racial profiling'” but no lawsuit was filed. The controversy over the incident is tempered by time and distance but will be another talking point in the 2025 election season. CHS reported here on the challenges Harrell and other Seattle incumbents face standing strong against the Trump administration while also not attracting vindictive attention from Washington D.C. Harrell is shaping his reelection campaign with themes around “common values,” “public safety solutions,” and “proven leadership to stand up for our values.” So far, his field of challengers is limited to candidates with little or no political experience in the city. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

https://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2025/05/seattle-police-clear-sunbathers-at-denny-blaine-park/,Capitol Hill Seattle,"CHS Capitol Hill Seattle News Seattle Police clear sunbathers at Denny Blaine Park — UPDATE: Mayor, Hollingsworth respond LATEST CHS SUBSCRIBER TOTAL: 1,236","Police were at Denny Blaine Sunday(Image: @mom_calls_me_myrtle) A police officer “on a premise” assignment at Denny Blaine Park caused a stir Sunday at the nude beach east on the shores of Lake Washington. The Seattle Police Department is apparently cracking down on the popular Capitol Hill sunny day getaway. Reports describe multiple police officers called to the scene Sunday telling afternoon park goers to cover up and trespassing one sunbather who refused, according to Colleen Kimseylove of the Friends of Denny Blaine Park community group that has been trying to find solutions that protect the park’s history and place in Seattle queer culture while also placating increasing hostile neighbors in the wealthy neighborhood that surrounds the nude-friendly beach and park that has been affectionately known as Dykiki for decades. “When Kimseylove arrived, they spoke to SPD Officer Ella Brooks who told Kimseylove that no Seattle law protects nudity, and if someone called and complained, SPD officers had to respond,” independent Seattle news site The Burner reports. “The cops also told Kimseylove that someone had directed SPD to routinely check in on the park. They told Kimseylove that people needed to put their clothes on or be trespassed or potentially arrested.” SPD reportedly told one sunbather who argued with officers Sunday they were banned from the park for the week. The department has not publicly provided details of the order. Seattle Parks, whose Park Rangers are authorized to formally trespass individuals for breaking park rules, says it issued no trespasses at the park this weekend. The police presence at the park began just before 2:30 PM Sunday when an officer checked in on East Precinct radio “on a premise” in Denny Blaine Park. Less than five minutes into the beat, she called in for a supervisor. While an officer reporting in “on a premise” can have multiple meanings, it typically indicates an officer is beginning a patrol at an assigned location. Officers check in this way, for example, when SPD is conducting emphasis patrols at specific locations like a school or a business. CHS asked SPD for more information about the incident that followed, the reported trespass, and the premise assignment but the department has not yet responded. The Burner reports it has been told that neighbors have also hired private security to keep watch on the park and deal with police. The apparent crackdown follows filing a lawsuit from unnamed park neighbors demanding the city address concerns at Denny Blaine over “public masturbation, public sex and other types of indecent exposure, drug use, unlawful public nudity, environmental damage to the shoreline, and scofflaw parking.” The suit all but ends any chance at goodwill and compromise the Friends of Denny Blaine group has been forging. The group has been meeting regularly to find community solutions that also protect the park’s place with queer and nudist communities. The friends group successfully pushed back in 2023 on a plan quietly shepherded by Mayor Bruce Harrell to add a children’s playground to the park with the help of a no longer-anonymous donation from Denny Blaine neighbor and Seattle mall developer Stuart Sloan. Sunday, meanwhile, is not the first time officials have tried to change behavior at Denny Blaine. Seattle Parks has tried here and there over the years to timidly suggest sunbathers cover up but never before with cops threatening arrest. Given the city and SPD’s silence on the matter so far, it may not be the last. Sunday’s weather was 60 F and breezy. Tuesday, highs are predicted to approach 80 F before a bout of rain hits the city this weekend. UPDATE: We’ve also reached out to District 3 representative and chair of the city council’s parks committee Joy Hollingsworth to learn more about what is being done to protect community use of the park and will update when we hear back. UPDATE x2: Hollingsworth declined to comment at this time. “Once we receive more information and facts, we will have a better understanding of the situation,” the council member said. UPDATE x3 5/7/2025 8 AM: Hollingsworth says she is “continuing to closely monitor the situation at Denny Blaine Park, particularly in light of the events that took place last Sunday.” In a statement posted Tuesday on social media, Hollingsworth, who is gay, said she recognizes “the deep significance of Denny Blaine to our LGBTQ+ community” and is “committed to preserving and protecting safe, inclusive public spaces for all.” Hollingsworth, chair of the council’s parks committee, says she has been in “active communication” with the Seattle Police Department, Seattle Parks and Recreation, and the Mayor’s Office about the Sunday enforcement, and expressed her concerns over the situation, “underscoring the need for a thoughtful, community-centered approach moving forward.” SPD’s enforcement efforts don’t seem to fit that approach. For now, Hollingsworth is still talking compromise. “My ongoing hope—and priority—is that we can collaboratively develop a solution that respects the park’s unique heritage while ensuring the safety, dignity, and well-being of everyone who visits,” she concludes. Katie Wilson, who is challenging incumbent Bruce Harrell for the Seattle Mayor’s office this year, also added her voice to the condemnation of SPD’s actions, calling the actions a seeming “Plan B” after efforts to change Denny Blaine like plans for the playground were scuttled. “As I’ve been talking with voters around the City, I hear again and again that people want a police force that is adequately staffed but also responsive, trustworthy, and accountable to the communities it serves,” Wilson said in her updates on social media. “It was jarring to read this story about Denny Blaine just after a grocery worker told me about nearly being stabbed on the job and then waiting a very, very long time for police to arrive. What are our priorities? Why are we sending police to harass harmless people hanging out at a queer nude beach?” “Of course, we know why,” she writes. “Because wealthy neighbors don’t want those people there. Just like they wanted the City to build a playground at Denny Blaine to drive them out. And Mayor Harrell’s administration was all set to oblige— until the community organized & pushed back.” “It’s hard to avoid the suspicion that this police prodding is Plan B,” Wilson said. “And it certainly sounds like this strategy is coming from the top. It is mind-boggling that with the multiple major challenges and crises our city is facing, this is what we’re doing.” Harrell, who said he shared “disgust” over the complaints of nudity and lewd behavior at the park in text messages revealed last year, has not yet publicly responded to the Sunday SPD enforcement at the park. UPDATE x4 5/7/2025 9:50 AM: In a statement, the his office say Mayor Harrell has not “directed a change to SPD patrols or approach to enforcement at Denny Blaine Park.” “As we’ve said before, Mayor Harrell recognizes that people have a right to use the park nude under State law,” a spokesperson said. The spokesperson told CHS the mayor’s office would need to “defer to SPD on the details of specific events or any individual enforcement actions taken.” SPD’s communications team has not replied to CHS’s previous inquiries about the situation. We have added them to our conversation with the mayor’s office. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2024/12/23/79839659/king-county-metro-bus-driver-shawn-yims-death-is-a-tragedy,The Stranger,King County Metro Bus Driver Shawn Yim’s Death Is a Tragedy Just Can't Get Enough?,"On Saturday, Seattle Police Department (SPD) officers arrested a man suspected of killing King County Metro bus driver Shawn Yim, a tragedy marked over the weekend with a vigil at the scene of his death in the University District. The attack represented the first killing of a Metro bus driver in 26 years. The King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office released details about the attack over the weekend. Just before 3 am on December 18, Yim picked up two passengers from a bus stop on 15th Avenue and 43rd Street NE, directly across from the University of Washington campus. As one of the passengers boarded, he closed a bus window. This sparked an argument between Yim and the passenger: Yim said the window needed to stay open to prevent the glass from fogging up, while the passenger said he was cold. Yim drove just two blocks before stopping to close the window. According to court documents, the argument escalated and Yim ultimately told the man to exit the bus. The man then walked up to Yim, and allegedly pepper sprayed him, before stepping off the bus. Yim followed and the man sprayed Yim again, allegedly kicked him, and then walked away. Yim continued to trail the man, calling 911 and saying a passenger had attacked him. Yim told dispatch, “Hurry please … he’s fleeing.” Surveillance video showed Yim following the man for about a minute, before the man turned around and the two began to fight. The man allegedly stabbed Yim about 10 times before walking away, leaving Yim on the ground. Less than a minute later, the other passenger from the bus can be seen on surveillance video checking on Yim. He told police that Yim already appeared unresponsive at that point. Yim’s death spurred a manhunt and a flurry of news articles. KOMO described how the man suspected of stabbing Yim had dragged the driver off the bus, which turned out to be false. Multiple outlets blasted out the suspect’s name and photo after SPD posted it online. Others, such as The Stranger and the Seattle Times, refrained from naming the suspect prior to prosecutors filing formal charges, which the King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office (KCPAO) finally did Monday, charging 53-year-old Richard Sitzlack with murder. The KCPAO spokesperson Casey McNerthney said his office and SPD detectives became aware of Sitzlack last year when SPD officers arrested him for murder in connection to the stabbing death of his roommate in November 2023. Prosecutors never filed formal charges however, and McNerthney said while police investigators initially had doubts about Sitzlack’s claim of self-defense, he said further investigation seemed to support Sitzlack’s story. In the hours after the stabbing, King County Officials such as King County Executive Dow Constantine, officials from King County Metro, and representatives with the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 587, held a press conference about Yim’s death. The union called for an expansion of the transit police force and for the installation of protective cages for drivers. The union’s president, Greg Woodfill, argued the county and the region haven't done enough to keep drivers safe. Over the last two decades, assaults against Metro bus drivers have generally decreased from the highs of the early 2000s, such as in 2006 when drivers reported 189 assaults in one year. In 2018, with daily ridership close to about 400,000, the number of assaults hovered at about 81 that year, with 40 of those incidents involving passengers spitting on drivers. With daily ridership sitting just below 300,000 in 2023, there were 34 assaults, nine of which involved spitting. As of November this year, Metro has recorded just 15 assaults even as daily ridership continues to rebound since the pandemic. That said, some drivers have busier routes, may have faced multiple assaults over their time at Metro, and many drivers view this as a cumulative issue, and not easily quantified. The number of assaults directly against drivers is one statistic and it doesn’t encapsulate all the times drivers felt unsafe on their buses. Bus drivers deal with passengers fighting, people overdosing, and, in general, people kind of sucking sometimes. Even before Yim's death, it became clear something had come to a head for drivers when last week Metro announced that it planned to close its stops at 12th Avenue and Jackson Street because of potential dangers to its drivers and passengers. Yim's death led to renewed calls from the drivers' union for better barriers to protect them from attacks and random riders' spit. At the same time, the union’s demands for more transit police seems like a way to exacerbate the issue of people becoming more agitated in this City, and create more hostility to people in poverty. In particular, the city’s police force seems already predisposed to be hostile to the homeless. Kristina Sawyckyi happened to be handing out meals in the University District as cops searched for the suspect in the stabbing. She described watching as members of law enforcement approached homeless people hanging near bus stops and started shining flashlights in their faces. She said she heard the officers yelling about how homeless people in Seattle commit so much crime and are a burden and a problem. SPD spokesperson Eric Muñoz said he was on scene the day of the stabbing and he was “not aware of any of this.” SPD officers, KCSO deputies, and UW Police Officers all helped with the search, he said and he cannot speak for what any officers may have said during that time. Greg Kim with the Seattle Times just wrote an excellent piece about how Mayor Bruce Harrell’s plans to clean up downtown have yielded major results along Third Avenue in the last two months. Kim described how a combination of arrests and street ""cleanings"" have led to a lower number of reported crimes, calls for drug activity, and people on the streets. But as Kim said, the disorder ""didn’t go far."" Kim pointed out how as Third Avenue calmed down, issues in the Chinatown International District simultaneously surged, and gave examples such as the stabbing that injured nine people in November. Kim describes how police have become more physical with people living homeless on Third Avenue, grabbing them by the shirt, and making them feel unwelcome. However, these individuals are often pushed into Little Saigon, right near where Metro had to close the 12th Avenue and Jackson Street bus stops. These policies don’t reduce poverty and addiction; they simply keep people struggling with these concerns constantly on the move. And the easiest, cheapest way to move around this city is public transit. And while in the coming days, many people will stress that public transit is generally safe, the other point to remember is that people are generally safe too. Including the people on public transit who make you uncomfortable with their mental illness and poverty. However, even a typically safe person, when dealing with constant instability, fear, and violence, may lash out during a particularly bad day. (That said, unhoused people are far more likely to be the victims of a violent crime than the perpetrators.) And look, I don't know much about this Sitzlack guy, and whether the city could have done something to prevent this tragedy. I wish I did. What I do know is that the more this city treats the homeless and the people struggling with addiction like criminals, rather than a population who need services, money, and evidence-based support, the deeper the city pushes them into poverty, illness, and crime. Instead of increasing police, we should focus on improving the lives of our citizens. We should finally create a functioning police alternative to help people in crisis—a program that continues to flounder in Seattle due to resistance from our police union and the Mayor’s constant capitulation to their demands. We should make sure JumpStart money goes toward housing, not our bloated police overtime budget. We should create hiring incentives for social workers and mental health counselors, not cops. We should make sure people in this city fall into a social safety net, not a jail cell.",,"['mayor', 'budget', 'housing', 'homeless', 'police', 'SPD']",13.0,2025-08-01T13:51:03.814875,8139

Tuesday night’s Young Democrats at UW Candidate Forum will be broadcast online. Check out @youngdemocrats_uw for details and links. Seattle’s 2025 races for mayor, city attorney, and three seats on the city council will involve Seattle’s wall of mostly moderate Democrat incumbents facing challenges from the left — and a few from the right. One Capitol Hill-based political opponent to Mayor Bruce Harrell won’t be taking him on in the primary. Broadway boutique-owner and Republican neighborhood activist Rachael Savage has opted to file to be part of the race to challenge Alexis Mercedes Rinck for her citywide Position 8 seat on the city council. CHS asked Savage about the change after months of fundraising built around her planned challenge to Harrell. The mayor’s race has drawn eight other challengers to Harrell, however. CHS reported here on the campaign launch earlier this year for progressive activist Katie Wilson who has worked with organizations like the Transit Riders Union, and helped lead minimum wage and renter rights campaigns around the region. On the other side of the spectrum, business friendly candidate and former T-Mobile executive Joe Mallahan is back for a reheat more than a decade after he and Mike McGinn knocked incumbent Greg Nickels out in the city’s 2009 primary. McGinn, of course, battled with Mallahan over things like the plans for the First Hill Streetcar but went on to easy victory that fall. The Savage campaign says the arrival of Mallahan in the race signaled its exit, saying the “last minute entry of millionaire candidate into the race changed the math.” Now, the Savage campaign folks say they have a “winnable race” lined up for the council.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/05/23/80070168/whats-behind-the-gilded-doors-of-aegis-senior-living,The Stranger,What’s Behind the Gilded Doors of Aegis Senior Living? Just Can't Get Enough?,"If you’ve seen old folks’ homes with a certain Cheesecake Factory aesthetic popping up around Washington, you know Aegis Living. A private pay assisted living chain that does not accept Medicare, Aegis owns $2.5 billion in property across Washington, California, and Nevada, including 23 “luxury” senior living centers in the Seattle area. Aegis’ CEO claims that the company brings in nearly $250 million in annual operating revenues from resident costs that can climb into the tens of thousands of dollars per month. Living at Aegis appears to be worth it, though: in March, their Greenwood facility was named the number one senior living facility in the country. With Medicaid cuts threatening to shut down many of our elder care facilities in the Pacific Northwest, there’s never been a better time to get to know our local retirement home landlord. To understand Aegis Living, you need to know about Dwayne J. Clark, the charismatic CEO driving the company’s vision. Clark has done a good job of building his mythology. In puff pieces like his most recent in Seattle Magazine, he talks about a childhood marked by hardship: His father left when he was five, and Clark’s mother raised him and his three siblings in Lewiston, ID, before relocating to Spokane, WA. He and his three siblings didn’t have much. In a story Clark recounts often, his family struggled so badly once that his mother, a line cook at the Elks Lodge in Lewiston, smuggled home a handful of potatoes from work and turned them into soup that sustained the family for a week. If you believe his PR efforts, Dwayne J. Clark was a bootstrappin’ young kid who was so inspired by his mother’s hardships that he made it his life’s mission to give our aging seniors more dignified lives—a serious and noble endeavor. But the truth is uglier. And weirder. It appears Clark is another classic American huckster who repeats half-truths and outright fabrications, never letting the truth get in the way of a good story while he does the opposite of what he claims: making elder care less accessible and making a fortune on the backs of underpaid workers. Inside Clark’s gaudy Aegis facilities are vulnerable elderly folks paying exorbitant costs to be treated by a constantly revolving team of low-paid workers and third-party contractors, causing dangerous conditions that have led to multimillion-dollar lawsuits, hundreds of complaints to the state, felony criminal charges—and questions about who will take care of us when we get old. Who Dreams of Owning Elder Care Facilities? In podcasts, interviews, and on his website, Clark says he bounced around a while as a young adult, studying at Chaminade University in Hawaii and then Gonzaga, before ultimately dropping out. Clark says he then drifted through a series of dead end jobs including a particularly intense-sounding one at the Washington State Penitentiary. “I worked in the criminal justice system at a maximum-security prison in Walla Walla,” he told Seattle Magazine. “I carried a gun and went through Washington station training. I was on a tactical unit that would disrupt people that were taken hostage.” He told the American Seniors Housing Association that around that time, his sister told him to look into the aging population of America and consider getting into the soon-to-be booming industry of elder care. Clark interviewed with a business in that field, and after working there a few years, he started Aegis Living with a business partner in 1997. ""Our priority is to build in the most exclusive markets we can, with the highest barriers of entry, so it will be a long time before the competition comes in behind us,” Clark told the Puget Sound Business Journal in 2002. “We want to be in the highest-wealth cities in the US."" That business model is obvious to everyone around the empire. “It just seems like so much of it is designed to separate people from their life savings,” says Will Brattain, a former certified nursing assistant (CNA) at Aegis Ravenna from July 2022 to February 2024. “You need this, you don't really know what your options are, this seems like the best bet, and then all of a sudden you're paying $12,000 a month and there goes your house and there goes everything that you've accumulated over the years, your children's inheritances. It's all just getting sucked up by Dwayne.” Violet Lawler, a former employee at top-rated Aegis Greenwood, was in the room for a mandatory presentation from Clark at her workplace in 2023. Afterward when she chatted with him he was polite and seemingly willing to discuss any topic. She was curious about Aegis’ high costs, which are roughly four times the national average for assisted living communities and can climb as high as $30,000 per month for residents and their families depending on the level of care provided. Violet Lawler says she asked Clark, “Have you ever considered building a community that's more catered to the middle class?” Clark’s demeanor quickly changed, she says. “We looked into it,” he said. “There’s no money in it.” Then, she says, he walked away. Neither Clark nor Aegis Living responded to The Stranger’s multiple requests for comment. The Benevolent Billionaire In Clark’s many interviews, podcast appearances, and social media posts, the subtext is clear: Trust me, I’ll take good care of your aging family members. With Seattle’s aging population, more of us will depend on facilities like Clark’s, and it feels good to be told we’ll be in good hands when we can’t take care of ourselves. But are we? Let’s start at the top, with Clark. Clark presents himself as a bit of a hero, who worked hard, pulled himself up by his bootstraps, and found a way to make a difference in elder care. Remember how Clark said when he was younger, he worked at a “maximum-security prison,” “carried a gun,” and would “disrupt people that were taken hostage”? The Department of Corrections has no records of a Dwayne Clark ever working around that time at the Washington State Penitentiary, the only maximum-security prison in Walla Walla. Same for the Walla Walla Police Department. In fact, according to the city of Walla Walla, during that time period, no one named Dwayne Clark worked for the city in any capacity. He doesn’t hide his wealth: At the Aegis “home office” in Bellevue, Clark displays a motorcycle reportedly once owned by deceased actor Robin Williams. For his annual Christmas party, he lines up his collection of Lamborghinis and Ferraris around the circular driveway at his mansion in Medina. Clark presents himself as the human embodiment of Aegis’ success, showcasing photos on his website with former presidents, billionaire CEO’s, and celebrities. But he wants you to believe that he gives a great deal of it away to the less fortunate: a benevolent billionaire. One of the good ones. On his website, Clark writes, “The Clark Family Foundation was founded in 2017 to care for the most vulnerable people in society. Its major focus is on elderly and children.” However, tax forms show the foundation functions primarily as a way for Clark to funnel money to well-funded private schools on the Eastside. The foundation’s most recent tax returns show that in 2023, it only made two donations—$50,000 to Eastside Catholic high school in Sammamish, one of the most expensive high schools in the area; and $200,000 to St Thomas, an elite K-8 school in ritzy Medina—and carried into 2024 nearly $1.5 million dollars of undistributed funding. Maybe next year they will get to “the most vulnerable people in society.” His Queen Bee Cafe, formerly a chain with locations in Seattle, now has only one shop in the bougie Clyde Hill neighborhood in Bellevue, where it proudly displays above its front door, “YOU DINE. WE DONATE.” Its website claims, “We are a not-for-profit café. 100% of our proceeds benefit local charities selected each year. So feel good! Because one cup at a time, together we’re making a difference.” The organization isn’t registered as a non-profit in Washington state, instead functioning as an LLC owned by Aegis. As a not-for-profit, Queen Bee Cafe isn’t required to disclose where they donate their money. But one would assume the organization would be at least somewhat transparent, given such a loud declaration of “YOU DINE. WE DONATE.” However, Queen Bee Cafe doesn’t make specific information about their donations public, instead offering a list of charities on their website they claim they’ve donated to since the cafe opened. But none of the charities listed on Queen Bee Cafe’s website confirmed ever receiving more than $20,000 in a year from Aegis. A representative from the Greater Seattle Business Association Scholarship Fund—the only organization who would speak on the record about Queen Bee Cafe’s donation history— confirmed that despite being listed on their website, the GSBA hasn’t received any donations from Queen Bee Cafe since 2017. And from 2015 to 2017, they only received a paltry total of $1,767. Clark's political donations are some of the only transparent proof of his “charity,” including many donations to conservative candidates like John McCain, Marco Rubio, Dave Reichert, and in 2023 over $13,000 to Nikki Haley. He has personally given $24,000 to American Senior Housing Association, a Political Action Committee that donates to Republican candidates who advocate for the end of Medicare. His most recent donation was in December 2024. And then there’s The Potato Soup Foundation. Remember the story Clark tells about a lean period growing up when his family ate potato soup for a week? Clark claims during that time his mother told him, “Now I don’t want you to forget, employees have needs just like we’re having this need right now and, you always need to be there for your employees and they’ll always be there for you.” Let’s just assume we live in a universe where she actually did say that. Clark seems to have taken away a strange lesson. Instead of directing some of the company’s profits toward employees in need, he concluded that workers should support each other. Employees of Aegis Living can contribute a portion of their paycheck to the Potato Soup Foundation, a charity Clark set up to help Aegis workers who have hit hard times. “If you can’t eat, we’ll feed you,” Clark told Seattle Business Magazine in 2013. “If someone needs emergency dental surgery and can’t afford it, we’ll pay for it.” Violet Lawler recalls the company often sharing a story about helping an employee who couldn’t afford to repair her broken-down car. “Why was she not being paid enough to get her car fixed?” Violet asks. “The general managers say this is a great thing that Dwayne Clark has done, but they never tell us how to apply for it,” says Anthony Ledesma, former lead housekeeper at Aegis Greenwood. “If someone came to me and asked me how to initiate it, I wouldn't have any way to point them to it.” Since 2007, tax returns show that Clark’s Potato Soup Foundation received over $1.3 million in donations. Although in interviews, Clark says the foundation is primarily funded by Aegis workers donating a percentage of their paychecks, the website claims it also receives funds “from outside organizations and donors.” Their tax returns don’t list any of these outside organizations or donors. They say that over $1 million in donations to the Potato Soup Foundation have been dispersed, but do not identify where these funds have gone. We are able to verify one public instance of an Aegis worker who received funds from the Potato Soup Foundation. In March 2021, a care worker named Nick Reyes from Aegis’ Dana Point, CA, location died from COVID-19. Dwayne Clark helped set up a GoFundMe page for the family and even wrote something urging others to donate. In the Potato Soup Foundation’s tax returns, they report that they brought in $20,000 from a fundraising event for the Reyes family. And, sure enough, on the public GoFundMe page, there is a donation from the Clark Family Legacy Foundation to help Reyes’ grieving family: but for only $10,000. Half of what they claimed they received in donations. The Line Workers Many current and former Aegis employees expressed concerns with the inconsistencies in the way Clark represents himself, but over and over again they said the most offensive claim was that he values his employees. Despite Aegis making nearly $250 million per year in annual revenue, very little trickles down to the “line workers” (as they’re called at Aegis) who directly interact with the senior citizens in Aegis’ self-described “luxury communities.” Although Clark claims they pay industry-standard rates or better, caregivers, kitchen workers, and housekeepers are hired at barely above minimum wage, typically no more than $20 per hour. One of Aegis’ main competitors, Horizon House, is a similarly luxury private-pay assisted living community. Their union contract with SEIU 775 starts workers with no experience at $24 per hour. A representative from SEIU 775 says that ⅓ of workers start higher than that. The living wage in King County is $30.82. In a Facebook post in 2022, Clark reflected on his rise to success from making just $6 per hour at age 16 working the “wheat fields and pea fields of Walla Walla.” According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, $6 in 1974 is worth over $40 today—two times as much as he pays his line workers. SEIU 775, the union who represents the workers at Aegis Ravenna, has been trying to negotiate a fair contract with Aegis for nearly two years now. Aegis is reportedly offering only pennies in compromise. According to someone familiar with the talks, the union is asking for more staffing and training to meet their elderly residents’ needs, as well as an additional $2-4 per hour for employees to match other competitive assisted living communities. Will Brattain, the former certified nursing assistant (CNA) at Aegis Ravenna from 2022 to 2024, says, “I was hired at $22 an hour and I was the highest-paid CNA in the building.” A former HR employee who worked at Aegis from 2021 to 2024 says if a candidate ever requested over $22 per hour, they had to get approval from their boss. “Rarely was it ever approved,” they say. “And in HR, you get what you pay for.” And it doesn’t appear to improve from there for the folks helping the residents. Violet Lawler says she started at Aegis in 2019 making $18 per hour as a life enrichment assistant, running activities for the residents. Over the years she was able to get marginal raises, but it wasn’t easy. “I was at $19 per hour when I learned that two male LEA’s (life enrichment assistants) with no prior experience had just been hired at $21 per hour. I called Aegis out on it and they bumped me up to the same rate,” she said. Eventually she made it up to $23 per hour. Then she hit a ceiling. Lawler says after working for Aegis for almost five years, including moving over to help them open their new Aegis Greenwood facility in 2022, and receiving positive performance reviews, at her annual performance meeting in January 2024 she was only offered a raise of 92 cents an hour. ”There was no explanation for why,” Lawler says. “And 92 cents is just insulting. It did not cover the cost-of-living increase. So when you look at it that way, you're almost making less money this year than you did last year.” Clark frequently claims employee turnover in the senior care sector is as high as 200%, and that at Aegis that figure is closer to 20 to 50 percent. Neither appear to be true. According to Seniorly, turnover for senior care facilities averaged 52.1% in 2024. As for that 20 to 50 percent turnover at Aegis claim? Workers tell a different story. “For sure, that’s an inaccurate statement,” said Anthony Ledesma to The Stranger in December 2024 when he was the lead housekeeper at Aegis Greenwood (he’s since left). “Especially with caregivers, the turnover rate is crazy. A lot of the caregivers that I knew when I started are gone now.” Anthony was hired only a year earlier, in December 2023. Violet Lawler says after helping open the Greenwood location in 2022, she estimates of her roughly 40 original co-workers across five departments, only two were still employed there two years later. The data seems to agree. During their contract bargaining, Aegis shared headcount data with SEIU 775, the union representing the workers at Aegis Ravenna. A report from January 2024 shows that in 2023, turnover at that location was 92.1%. A June 2024 report shows that turnover for that year was already at 56.1% only halfway through the year. Then, according to Megan Parke from SEIU 775, Aegis stopped responding to information requests. “A lot of people were leaving and taking jobs at Dick's or other fast food restaurants because they're more money, less stress, and less responsibility,” a former HR employee who left the company in 2024 says. Low pay isn’t all that’s driving workers away from Aegis. In a class-action lawsuit in 2018, over 10,000 former employees in Washington and California alleged, in part, that Aegis was violating elder financial abuse and consumer protection laws by deliberately understaffing their facilities. One worker also claimed they were paid $5.82 per hour when their contract was for $17 per hour. (The sanitized version that was reported in the press on sites like McKnight’s Senior Living claimed the suit merely alleged the company made “staffing decisions were based on budgets rather than resident care needs.”) “The core of our mission and culture is to provide the highest level of care for our residents. From the beginning, we have fervently disputed the allegations in this case,” Aegis Living General Counsel Elizabeth Chambers told McKnight’s Senior Living. “After several years of aggressively litigating, we made the decision to stop fighting, collaborate with the plaintiff’s attorneys, and put an end to this case so we can continue focusing our full attention on what matters most — our residents, their families and our team.” The company agreed to settle the lawsuit in 2021 by paying the plaintiffs $16.25 million. A complaint filed with the Seattle Office of Labor Standards (OLS) shows a pattern of wage discrepancy. A former employee at the Madison location from November 2021 to January 2022 alleged she was hired at a rate of $17.50 per hour but paid at the rate of $17.25 for months. She was also allegedly promised a typical morning-afternoon shift then after hiring, was instructed to work the opening shift starting at 5:30 am. At that time, the worker says, Aegis’ payroll system went down and she began receiving odd amounts of money through physical checks and direct deposits with no formal accounting of her hours or Paid Sick and Safe Time. When she requested the terms she originally agreed to, and for formal pay stubs, she says she was ignored. When she walked out, she was fired. A second complaint with the OLS in 2021 alleged that Aegis refused to pay a worker’s Paid Sick and Safe Time, and neglected on five separate occasions to pay him overtime rates on short notice. Both workers found employment elsewhere, and OLS referred them to Washington State Labor & Industries to file a claim. Understaffing is a widespread issue as well, according to workers. Gurnesh Chetty, a medical technician at Aegis Ravenna since April 2021, says, “We’re always understaffed. Then when staff asks management for help, the response we always get is, ‘We don’t have the budget to hire more staff.’ But they have the budget to open a new location every month.” “It's low pay,” Violet Lawler says. “Everybody is getting run into the ground. Everybody is just absolutely worked to the bone. We care so much about the job that we kind of put up with it for longer than we should. The burnout level is so incredibly high.” “Tired people make mistakes, and mistakes cause accidents. Those accidents can be life or death,” Will Brattain says. Fed up with these conditions, the staff at Aegis’ Ravenna location started organizing in late 2022. Once word got to corporate, instead of meeting with their workers to figure out solutions, the company went into protection mode. They’d already been fined $53,451 by the National Labor Relations Board for anti-worker surveillance and retaliation, but now—with the help of notorious union-busting firm Morgan Lewis—they ramped it up even further. In a closed-door meeting, those with direct knowledge say Clark gave executives specific marching orders: no union sympathizers. Jeri Leasure, former head of recruiting at Aegis, says that in the summer of 2022, “Dwayne had what he called a ‘fireside chat’ at the home office, where he invited all the GMs from all of his communities to come to the home office and lectured them about how they needed to scrub social media, they needed to scrub the resumes, they needed to make sure no one was affiliated with a union.” She says shortly after, she interviewed a cook for an open job at Aegis’ Lake Union location. Then, she says, she got a call from the regional culinary services director. “She goes, ‘Not only no, but hell no. He used to work at Lumen Field, and they’re all union,’” Jeri says she was told. SEIU 775 has filed 47 Unfair Labor Practice charges against Aegis with the National Labor Relations Board, alleging illegal surveillance and retaliation, among other charges. In one outrageous case, the general manager at Aegis Greenwood allegedly saw one of their workers speaking to SEIU representatives on her lunch break off of company grounds. So they fired her at the end of the day. Former colleagues allege that Dwayne J. Clark also perceived that this new union push was caused by college-educated workers infiltrating their workforce. So the solution, according to multiple former HR employees, was to reject candidates with college degrees or even just resumes that looked “too polished.” One HR employee says they were told their ideal candidate was “dumb enough, but good enough for the job.” In May 2024, when Aegis opened their new 48,000-square-foot Laurelhurst building across from the University of Washington, the company put on a job fair but recruiters were instructed to not hire any UW students. “‘We’re not going to hire anybody that’s going to UW or any colleges because they study unions,’” Jeri says she was told by her boss, the Vice President of Talent. “The recruiter running that job fair came up to me and she was like, ‘How the hell am I not going to hire any students?’” Jeri told the recruiter to go ask the new Vice President of Talent. “Make all the shifts 8-to-5, and they need to be available seven days a week,” she was told by the Vice President of Talent. “That’s how you will deter any student.” In the summer of 2024, workers at the corporate office raised concerns not only about these anti-union hiring practices, but also alleged discrimination in the workplace. After this new VP of Talent was hired that spring, positions that brought in hundreds of applicants only resulted in interviews for one profile of candidate: white women in their 20’s. Jeri said she felt her new boss was hiring younger recruiters around her to push her out. She is a single mother and her teenage son—who also worked at Aegis—was just in a life-threatening car accident. She desperately needed to keep her job. Jeri went to one of her other bosses to raise these concerns. “Listen, the discrimination has to stop,” Jeri says she told her boss. “It’s the union. It’s race. It’s age.” “No, no, no. I don’t think that’s what she’s doing,” Jeri says she was told by her boss. A week later, Aegis fired Jeri. Her son, too. The Trickle-Down Effect Most concerning is the effects these management practices are having on Aegis Living’s clients: vulnerable elderly people in need of protective care. “They are a profoundly corrupt organization,” says an Issaquah man named David Pollock whose mother and father lived at Aegis of Bellevue. “There isn’t just fire where there’s smoke. It’s a forest fire.” In 2014, Pollock and his family received an email from Aegis informing them that care for their elderly father needed to be ramped up from 8-10 hours per day to 24/7 care, with a hefty price increase to $6,000 per week. The family was concerned about the cost and wanted to make sure he was getting qualified help, so they asked if they could vet and hire outside help to come in and help their father. But after the company “very strongly objected,” the family reluctantly agreed to pay to ramp up his care at Aegis. But just to be sure, the Pollock family installed a camera in their father’s room. What Pollock reports he saw was appalling. When he would visit his father, “he would have a thick beard and was dressed in his same clothes day after day.” According to a lawsuit they later filed against Aegis, not only did the video footage show their father was not receiving the round-the-clock care they were now paying for, but he was being ignored while covered in his own urine and feces, kept awake by workers loudly talking and watching television in his room, and left alone without food or help getting outside for fresh air. He complained to two care team members as well as the general manager of the building. But Pollock says they were more worried about the camera in the room, which they confiscated and refused to return, than addressing his concerns about his father’s care. His father allegedly lost 24 pounds in January 2014 and another 15 in February before the family removed him from the Aegis facility. “He’s going to die today!” Pollock says one of the Aegis workers told him as they wheeled his elderly father out. “You need to take him to the hospital.” Pollock did take his father to the hospital, and after several weeks there he improved. In a chilling moment, Pollock says his father told him that he had no memory of his previous six months living at Aegis. The family then moved their father to a family care facility, a more intimate six-person complex that was 20 percent cheaper than Aegis, they say, and he lived there happily for almost another year until dying from an accidental slip and fall. When Pollock and his family sued Aegis, the company fought the lawsuit on the technicality that since Washington state is a two-direction recording state, meaning both parties must consent, the video was inadmissible in court. Aegis sent Pollock a letter that they would sue the Pollocks for any losses incurred in the lawsuit unless they dropped it. So the Pollocks did. But in that letter from Aegis, the company split a curious hair. They claimed they didn’t have any liability in the case at all because the workers identified in the complaint weren’t technically employees of Aegis, but third-party contractors. How could that be true? Pollock wondered. A former member of Aegis’ HR team confirms that as recently as 2024, many workers in Aegis buildings are actually provided by a third-party staffing agency. “The staffing agencies don't have to follow the same regulations that we do,” said a former HR employee in late 2024. “I had employees that were coming from the agency that didn't have work authorization, you know, green cards or papers.” What was their primary consideration when considering third-party contractors? I asked. They said simply: “Cost.” In that class-action lawsuit from 2018, a plaintiff claimed that their family member, a resident who was paying $6,235 a month at Aegis Bellevue, was also dangerously neglected during her time at Aegis. The lawsuit alleged that on numerous occasions, “Ms. Shanahan’s family members found her unattended on the floor tangled in her bedding. She had sustained numerous unattended falls at Aegis, resulting in lacerations and bruises throughout her body.” In 2022, a caregiver at Aegis Shoreline raped two elderly women with Alzheimer’s. (The suspect pled guilty in January.) Because the two victims suffer from Alzheimer’s and cognitive issues, their claims at first were not escalated by family and staff. Then, two days after the reports were finally sent to the state, one of the victims pointed at one of the workers in the hallway and identified him as the man who raped her. Lauren Ragen, a daughter of one of the victims, told KUOW last year, ""I can only imagine how many situations like this have occurred that were swept under the rug, because the victim's experience wasn't a trusted source. So much has been taken from them already. We must take care of them."" In support of SB 5337, a new law establishing certification standards for memory care providers, 9 people testified to their experience with Aegis. “My dad’s time at Aegis Living and Life Care of Kirkland was a nightmare,” said Ginger Jackson of Issaquah. “He needed help with transfers, but at Aegis he didn't have a functioning call button.They kept saying they would fix it, or that they had already fixed it, but they hadn't. Understaffing is a huge issue. The care staff aren’t given the resources to do their jobs properly, they are stretched too thin, overworked and underpaid. Some of the most vulnerable people in our communities are in assisted living facilities. They need and deserve to be safe and cared for.” Jennifer Furch of Woodinville said, “The staffing ratio at Aegis Marymoor was inadequate, leaving residents without the attention and support they needed. Care staff, overburdened and undertrained, were unable to consistently deliver the services outlined in residents' care plans. Documentation of care was alarmingly absent, relying solely on verbal communication at shift change, which led to errors and lapses in care. Most troubling, staff were not trained to effectively communicate with residents who have dementia, leaving vulnerable individuals like my mother without the understanding and dignity they deserve.” Since September 2021, Aegis Living facilities have been reported to the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services 333 times, resulting in eight different fines for violations including not administering medications on time and potentially exposing residents to life-threatening diseases. In the past three years alone, residents and their families have filed 94 complaints to the Washington State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program, a federal organization that advocates for residents in assisted living facilities. Some of the complaints alleged “abuse, gross neglect, and exploitation.” Patricia Hunter, the Washington State Ombuds since 2011, says in the long-term care industry, the number of complaints against Aegis aren’t that far out of the norm. But for a luxury facility, they’re surprising. “I think the expectations [of residents at Aegis] are really high. But at that cost, why wouldn’t they be?” she says. Considering the huge price tag of Aegis facilities alongside these allegations of low pay, understaffing, and substandard care, Hunter says, “It sounds like a grift.” But none of these issues seem to be affecting Aegis’ bottom line. They’re preparing to break ground on two new senior housing facilities in Woodinville and Sammamish. And the accolades keep rolling in. One might wonder how Aegis Greenwood, home of the 92-cent raise, was recently named the best senior living facility in the country by Seniorly. It appears to be a byproduct of silence. Their website says, “To qualify for the Awards, communities must be in the top five percent of our consumer sentiment ratings, be free of serious licensing violations for the last 36 months and have no evidence of negative media coverage for the last 24 months.” That’s not all: McKnight’s Senior Living just named Clark their Pinnacle Awards Career Achievement Award winner for 2025. “Dwayne Clark generously shares the thinking behind his bold moves with others to move the sector forward, but he also leads by example — and what an example,” McKnight’s Editorial Director, Vice President, and Associate Publisher John O’Connor said in the announcement. The award-winner recently outlined his 2025 plans for Aegis for Senior Housing News. In his interview, he said he’s looking into artificial intelligence and offshoring jobs to reduce some of Aegis’ operations costs. “It’s funny to me, the way [Clark] describes his upbringing, the way that he describes his grandmother. His grandmother would not have been able to afford to live at Aegis,” says Will Brattain. Would she even want to? Would you? “As someone that's worked in that industry, I worry about what will happen when I get too old to take care of myself,” Will says. “I've worked at a nursing home, I've worked at Aegis assisted living, I've worked in independent care…and I can safely say that I would never put my aging relatives in Aegis Living.”",,"['candidate', 'budget', 'housing', 'police']",9.0,2025-08-01T13:51:03.795575,32745

https://www.thestranger.com/stranger-election-control-board/2025/02/10/79914866/have-you-voted-yet,The Stranger,Have You Voted Yet? Just Can't Get Enough?,"Seattle, you’re terrible at voting in special elections. According to the county’s website, in the April 2023 Special Election, nearly 1.4 million voters were registered in King County, but a measly 30.86 percent returned their ballots. Yikes! (Compare that to the 81 percent of King County’s registered voters who participated in the November General Election.) This year, our Special Election is in February (tomorrow!), and it’s an important one. Both social housing and money for schools are on the ballot. But as of this morning, only 16 percent of registered voters in King County have returned their ballots. We have to do better! And yes, I say “we” because, admittedly, I am part of that lazy/tired/busy 84 percent who have yet to vote. My ballot is also just sitting right here, unopened and unloved. Let’s change that together! To brush up on what’s on the ballot, check out our February 2025 Special Election Voting Guide. Just wanna skip to the answers? Cool. For Propositions Nos 1A and 1B first vote YES, and then vote for Proposition 1A. We explain why in our endorsement, but for even more information on why you should support 1A, read about what we found when we dug into the contribution records. It turns out a lot of rich, non-Seattle folks and Amazon are pushing really hard for 1B. Always suspicious! For schools, vote yes on both Proposition 1 and Proposition 2. Money for schools!—even if you’re grumpy about the whole school-closures debacle. Kids still have to show up in those buildings every day; we don’t give them a choice. You have until 8 pm tomorrow to slip your ballot into one of the many ballot boxes around town (find your closest option here)! (While you can generally send it in by mail, it’s a little late in the game to guarantee it’d be postmarked in time—dropping it in a ballot box is your best bet at this point.) Not registered? There’s still time to do that, too! You can register and vote in person on election day at the King County Elections Office.",,"['election', 'housing']",5.0,2025-08-01T13:51:03.782319,2002

https://www.thestranger.com/queer/2024/12/30/79845003/trans-immigrants-how-to-change-your-name-and-gender-markers,The Stranger,Trans Immigrants: How to Change Your Name and Gender Markers Just Can't Get Enough?,"The maddening experience of the average transgender US citizen is nothing next to the average transgender immigrant’s journey navigating the US immigration system. The government has clear answers for how trans citizens can change their gender markers on documents, at least until Donald Trump takes office and eliminates Joe Biden’s trans-friendly policies. It can be daunting and bureaucratic. Simple errors can derail you. But for the most part, citizens mail in generic forms, snap a photo, pay, and receive their documents in a few weeks. The process is straightforward and basically the same for everyone. For immigrants like you, lawyers told us what’s best depends on who you are and where you came from. To give an extreme example, the US is less likely to grant asylum to an undocumented transgender woman from Barcelona or Paris (I haven’t met either of you, but I’m sure you’re out there), as it would be to a Russian, Ugandan, or Honduran fleeing from danger in their home country. While we did our homework, and spoke to qualified lawyers, if there’s a law degree on our wall, I haven’t seen it. The best we can do is write a helpful, informed guide. For legal advice, speak to an immigration attorney. If you don’t have one, consider seeking low-cost or pro-bono immigration legal services in your area. Malou Chávez, executive director of Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, warned immigrants against trusting notarios, or people without law degrees who present themselves as experts of immigration law. Notarios exploit target vulnerable immigrant communities in times of confusion, like when the government announces changes to its process. “It could go different ways, but mostly it’s completing forms and providing advice even though the person is not an attorney,” she said. “Be cautious.” Though generally speaking, the advice for trans immigrants is the same as it is for trans citizens: Update your gender on federal documents while you can. The incoming Trump administration will likely make it harder to do so when it eliminates self-attestation, or the ability to proclaim your gender without a medical evaluation. We can’t be sure what exactly could change, but Trump has said that on day one of his presidency, the US government will adopt the position that there are only two genders, which he’s previously said are set at birth. For the time being, you don’t need a doctor’s letter to change the gender marker on all but one federal immigration document. If you’re applying for asylum, it may even help your case. If you’re undocumented and don’t have any forms to update, there’s a path forward for you too. None of this comes cheap. Updating your name and gender on USCIS documents can cost upwards of $495), and can’t be done all at once. Here’s how the US-CIS can make you US-Trans. If You’re Undocumented Find yourself a lawyer and file an asylum case, says Ava Benach, the founding partner at Benach and Collopy in Washington, DC. Her firm has handled hundreds of asylum cases for trans people. A trans identity makes for a strong claim because, despite the constant legislative attacks of the past four years, the United States remains one of the safest countries for trans people in the world. A trans Central American walking from Guatemala or El Salvador is not passing through many places they’d be free from a well-founded fear of persecution. “If you’re a trans person who’s come into the country in the last year, get yourself to a lawyer and consider applying for asylum,” Benach says. “But if you have been here longer than a year [and missed the deadline to file form I-589], there are commonly accepted exceptions to that rule.” Those exceptions include a person not identifying as trans until they’d lived in the states, starting hormone replacement therapy, updating identity documents, or an HIV diagnosis, which is statistically more common in the trans community and grounds for persecution on its own. Immigration attorneys say it’s common for immigrants from countries hostile to LGBTQ people not to explore their identity until they’ve been here for some time—either because it wasn’t safe or because in their culture, queer identity was flattened into a broader category of “something someone should never be.” Sometimes it’s masculine lesbians and feminine men figuring out their true gender identity, other times transgender men and women realize non-binary better describes them. These things take time and experience to discover, which doesn’t change the reality that deportation after transition could be dangerous—making a strong case for asylum. Trans people ineligible for asylum could instead qualify for withholding of removal, an alternate, less stable pathway of protection which allows someone to stay in the US indefinitely on a work permit. While withholding blocks the government from deporting a person to their home country, the US still has the ability to send them to another country that would take them, Benach says. Kelsey Shamrell-Harrington, managing attorney at LGBTQ immigrant legal services organization Entre Hermanos, says there’s growing consciousness among immigration judges that gender identity is fluid, especially for those escaping bigotry. It can depend on where the court is located, but “you’d be surprised,” she said. Her clients often ask if a judge will discriminate against them if they change their name or gender during asylum proceedings. “The US government is not authorized to discriminate against somebody because they’re trans,” Shamrell-Harrington says. “Being a transgender person generally means you’ll be more vulnerable for future violence. For that reason, I try to discourage people from letting the fear of what government officials think prevent them from living their truth, especially when their truth can be ultimately so protective for them.” Under current USCIS policy, LGBT are members of a protected group whose persecution makes them eligible for asylum. The Biden’s administration has already severely restricted asylum eligibility. A process made more difficult by Democrats will be made even worse by Trump. Project 2025, which we should consider a policy model until proven otherwise, calls for “asylum reform,” to eliminate expedited pathways, raise the standard for credible fear of persecution, and eliminate the “vague and overbroad” protections for social groups. But Trump won’t have ultimate power. He can initiate mass deportation without congressional approval, but making the changes suggested by Project 2025 would require action in the House and Senate. Not that that’s out of the question. Come Inauguration Day, conservatives will control all three branches of government. And like last time, Trump is likely to pack the courts with federally appointed judges sympathetic to Making the Bench Great Again. Fortunately, any changes will face lawsuits (and the last Trump administration lost lawsuits all the time). Remember Plants vs. Zombies? The next four years are going to be like that, but with lawyers throttling unjust law and policy. All the same, this oncoming shift is one of the compelling reasons undocumented trans people should consider filing for asylum today. Even if government workers want to accept these claims, they’ll have their marching orders from Trump. The biggest risks for any undocumented immigrant are detainment and deportation, but Benach says the danger is acute for trans immigrants, particularly undocumented trans women, who have suffered in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers. Anything that initiates a criminal process, from arrest to conviction, can draw ICE to an undocumented immigrant, and a significant number of trans people rely on sex work to pay the bills. The National Transgender Discrimination survey found 13% trans people have done sex work. The majority are trans women, who report discrimination keeping them out of other jobs. The risk of arrest could grow as more states consider criminalizing trans people from using single-gender facilities like bathrooms. Still, being trans in and of itself is not grounds for deportation and Trump is not prioritizing their removal. “If there’s going to be raids, it’s going to be at meat processing plants and construction sites. It’s going to be in buildings full of undocumented people,” Benach said. “If you don’t get arrested, chances are you’re not likely to become a target.” If You Are Documented In March 2023, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) updated its policy manual to accept self-identified gender markers for people requesting immigration benefits, and that gender marker does not need to match supporting documents. (At present, and likely for the foreseeable future, USCIS will only offer binary gender markers). USCIS provides instructions for correcting Arrival-departure records, employment authorization documents, permanent resident cards, and various travel documents. Applicants do not need to supply proof of their gender, with the exception of those replacing their naturalization certificate. If you have an employment authorization form or Green Card, you should also update your gender marker with the Social Security Administration. It’s free. Naturalized citizens should also update their US passports. Attorneys said they could think of very few instances where updating any of these documents could put someone in harm’s way—mostly having to do with how soon after a person submitted their forms after an arrest or conviction when they’d be better off laying low than catching the attention of the immigration authorities. If you’re seeking asylum and authorized to work, updating your documents could even help build a persuasive argument if it’s consistent with your case and your story. In many instances, it’s totally neutral. Even though the USCIS handles all these forms, changing each one comes with a slightly different process and price. The agency doesn’t change them all at once, lawyers said. Immigrants do not need to change all these forms–in fact, mismatched markers between USCIS documents are okay. In some cases, immigrants may not want to change them, either. For instance, most people aren’t presenting their arrival-departure records on a daily basis and travel documents are sometimes one-off. For some, it may be safest to avoid changing these: Border guards are not primarily known for friendliness and understanding, and if the gender marker on the passport from your home country does not match the gender marker on your USCIS-issued travel documentation, you could run into trouble when leaving or re-entering the country. Lawyers say to prioritize the documents you share with your employer and the authorities: Employment Authorization and Green Cards. Although you probably don’t keep a Naturalization Certificate rolled up in your pocket for daily use, you can change it. Immigration law is hard to DIY. Some immigration attorneys say you should consult your immigration attorney before you file any documents, while others say you can probably manage these steps on your own. If in doubt, send an email. Your immigration attorney probably has an opinion, too. Looping in an attorney won’t slow or accelerate the process. Everyone is subject to the same processing times. Fees vary from document to document. Here’s the department’s latest fee schedule, which is subject to change. Changing the Name or Gender Marker on your Employment Authorization Document For those who don’t know the ins-and-outs of this process, an employment authorization document (EAD) is what it sounds like: A document that allows foreign nationals to work in the US. But these physical cards serve the same important purpose as any photo ID. They’re typically valid for one year, and can be renewed at the halfway mark, six months before they expire. That’s as good a time as any to update the gender on this document. To update your gender marker on an employment authorization document, submit form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. If you’re renewing your EAF, try to submit this document at least 180 days before your current card expires (if you apply early, USCIS automatically extends authorization for 540 days). Check the box that suits you. At $495, this necessary annual expense is not cheap. When filling out the form, check filing category 1.b. Replacement of a lost, stolen or damaged EAD not due to USCIS error. With your form and filing fee, submit supporting documentation including: Depending on where you’re from—or if you’re a refugee, or asylee, a student, etc.—the USCIS might want something more from you. Check the special requirements here. If you’re eligible, you can file online here. If you can’t wait because you’re worried about Trump changing USCIS policy before it makes sense to renew your EAD, you can request a replacement from USCIS with the same form. If you don’t have an online account, you can also contact updategenderinfo@uscis.dhs.gov to request a correction to your name or gender marker. USCIS will ask you for the card with your old gender marker. Wait times for a new document may vary. Attorneys gave us different answers ranging from a minimum of three weeks to 11 months, depending on why you qualify for a work permit. Typically, they say the process is l shortest for asylum seekers and longest for parolees. To update your name on an employment authorization form, you will submit all the same documentation as you would for a gender marker change—plus a court order after you legally change your name in a District or Superior Court. (In Washington, name changes are automatically sealed in Superior Court). You don’t need to be a citizen to change your name in the US. Once you have a court order, provide it to USCIS with your application to renew. USCIS may ask you for a letter explaining why you’re changing biographic information. You shouldn’t expect to be asked for “proof” like a doctor’s letter, but it does happen. “Not to call anyone out, but I’ve seen it more from Texas,” says Kelsey Shamrell-Harrington, managing attorney at LGBTQ immigrant legal services organization Entre Hermanos. Seven out of ten times, her trans clients can update their gender no problem. It’s those three other times the department asks for documentation. USCIS will accept basically any letter from a medical professional confirming you are who you say you are. If an LGBTQ health clinic or LGBT-aware general practitioner is prescribing you hormones, they likely deal with this for insurance all the time, and would be able to quickly email one to you. Advocates for Trans Equality has this sample letter as well. Additionally, if you are scheduled for an interview with USCIS based on a pending application, you can also update your gender marker in person. That includes removal proceedings. Malou Chávez, executive director of Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, says asylum seekers should know their employment authorization and case are linked. If you update your gender or name on your card, make sure to update the court’s records as well. “That’s just different things attorneys and advocates know,” she says. “The process is so complex. While one person may not necessarily need an attorney to replace documents, it’s always advised. Presumably the attorney knows to think about all the different questions and possibilities.” An asylee can inform USCIS of a change to name or gender during one of those meetings. But if it’s far enough out, your attorney could also file a motion to amend your name and/or gender in the court’s records. “They’ve been very receptive to that,” Shamrell-Harrington says. “I’ve mostly practiced in the Seattle office. So if you’re practicing in Georgia, your experience may be different.” Changing the Name or Gender Marker on your Green Card. File form I-90 and pay the $495 fee to replace it. Under Part 2 of form I-90, or “Application Type,” check box 2.e., “My name or other biographic information has legally changed since the issuance of my existing card.” Look under “Specific Instructions” on page three of this form to determine what supporting documents USCIS requires from you. It depends on who you are and how you got here. For example, marriage-based Green Cards require marriage certificates, and employment-based Green Cards require a job offer. Generally though, prepare scanned photocopies of your current Green Card (front and back), valid passport (opened to the page with your photo and personal information), Social Security Card, and birth certificate. If USCIS requests an original copy of a document, the department will send it back to you. You’ll also submit the Green Card with your incorrect information. You can file online here. If you’re just changing your gender marker, check male or female. If you’re changing your name, see Item 4. Check yes and proceed to items 5.a. to 5.c. On the form, provide your name exactly as it is on your current Green Card. Along with your supporting documents, provide the court order from your legal name change in District or Superior Court. (Like all government forms, you can’t change your name on a permanent resident card until you’ve obtained a court ordered name change). Changing the Name or Gender on Your Naturalization Certificate File form N-565, along with the $555 filing fee and the supporting evidence outlined in this document. As of April, the government allows people to change their gender marker to X. To change your name, you’ll also need to provide a court ordered name change. To change both your name and gender, USCIS requires: If you’re applying from overseas and provide a foreign address, the department will send your new naturalization certificate to the nearest consulate, embassy, or USCIS field office to your address. You’ll get a letter telling you where to pick it up. Is This Going to Put Me at Risk? This is by far the most common question we’ve received. Many trans US citizens and immigrants alike are concerned changing their name and documents will put them on a government list, but according to every single expert and trans advocate that we’ve spoken to about this for months, in this rare instance, not fitting into the system benefits trans people. Changing your name or gender-marker on government documents will create a record of some kind. Federal agencies don’t process gender-marker changes with special gender-marker change forms. They’re the same generic forms everyone uses for applying and renewing. The federal government likely won’t be able to search for those specific records without an expensive overhaul to their databases. Why spend the money when surveilling social media is a easier and faster way to find trans people? That’s not to say delete your social media, but it's helpful to stack concrete vulnerabilities against the government actions of our nightmares. Plus, as advocates pointed out, statistics show trans people who carry documentation that doesn’t match their appearance are at risk of violence already. “Somebody needs to balance their own immediate day to day safety against the hypothetical risks,” said Olivia Hunt, policy director at the National Center for Trans Equality. According to the 2015 US Trans Survey, the largest dataset on trans people in the US currently available, nearly one-third (32%) of trans people who presented an identity document that did not match their presentation experienced discrimination, denial of service, and violence. But risk is a personal assessment. If you’re anxious, consider pushing through the feeling and ask what you’d do if you weren’t afraid. Ultimately, only you know the right answer.
