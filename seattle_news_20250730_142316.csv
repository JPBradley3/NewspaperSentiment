Now we’ll see if Rachael Savage is also an environmentalist. Washington’s Department of Ecology may be wandering into a neighborhood hornet’s nest as it begins the public process on the Stewart House Cleanup Site under its affordable housing grant program. The DESC and the department are entering into an agreement on a state funded cleanup of the site where decades of waste from oil furnaces has accumulated. The Belmont Ave properties home to a trio of former transitional housing buildings from Pioneer Human Services were acquired in a $6.5 million deal last year as the DESC made plans for a new 120-unit apartment building with onsite services for its residents on the block. A 30-day public comment period on the cleanup agreement ends at midnight on May 6th. “Many communities in Washington are facing a housing crunch, but one Ecology program is helping to ease the shortage,” the state’s announcement of public comment window reads. “Our Affordable Housing Cleanup Grant Program provides grants to developers to help clean up contaminated sites. In return, the developers redevelop the property, with at least 40% of the square footage slated for affordable housing for at least 30 years.” The documents from the agreement are posted here. “The properties have historically been the site of apartment buildings heated by oil furnaces. Soil at the cleanup site has been contaminated by petroleum products that leaked out of underground storage tanks,” the state says. “The extent of the contamination will be studied during the future remedial investigation phase.” The state grant process around the projects has been streamlined by the legislature. In 2022, the permanent program was established to provide the grants for planning and cleanup of contaminated sites intended for affordable development. But the process adds another wrinkle to the DESC’s plans in the neighborhood. CHS broke the news on the project this fall as the organization confirmed its planning for “a new Permanent Supportive Housing project” on the parcels it purchased over the summer. King County’s program to fund the projects says permanent supportive housing is housing “for a household that is homeless on entry, where the individual or a household member has a condition of disability, such as mental illness, substance abuse, chronic health issues, or other conditions that create multiple and serious ongoing barriers to housing stability.” City permitting is already approved to demolish the vacant buildings to make way for the new 120-unit DESC permanent supportive housing project. An August fire mostly destroyed one of the buildings waiting to be torn down. Belmont DESC will serve people earning 30% and 50% of Area Median Income who are experiencing chronic homelessness. DESC says its tenants usually earn about 9% to 12% of AMI. The Belmont building will feature only studio units and is being designed for single adult residents. Opposition to the project includes residents and building owners who say the area is already overburdened by the challenges around halfway houses and housing programs for at-risk populations. Broadway business owner and Republican candidate for mayor Rachael Savage made opposition to the plan an early foundation of her “Savage Citizens” campaign. “Capitol Hill already has over three hundred people housed in multiple buildings that operate on this model variously called Housing First, Permanent Supportive Housing or Low Barrier Housing,” Savage said “Our streets are in chaos. We have done enough.” Environmental appeals have become a regular aspect of the long delays faced by development projects around Seattle and, especially, in the city’s largest, most important decisions. CHS reported here as appeals including cases representing Madison Valley, Mount Baker, Hawthorne Hills, and “73 remaining Southern resident killer whales” have gummed up Seattle’s efforts to meet state zoning requirements and arrive at a new 20-year growth plan for the city. The Department of Ecology program, meanwhile, has already been at work in Seattle where a grant-boosted cleanup cleared the way for The Maddux, an affordable project from the Mt. Baker Housing organization just off Rainier. In 2018, the state awarded Mt. Baker Housing $400,000 to start assessing the cleanup project. The legislature later awarded another $6.2 million to finish the project. The cleanup began in June 2020 and took five months to complete. The corner had previously been home to a dry cleaner and gas station. An initial state report on the Stewart House site was completed in 2018. “The presence and/or condition of groundwater has not yet been assessed at the site,” the state’s updated reporting reads. The Department of Ecology is holding a hybrid in-person and virtual “open house” on the project on April 15th. Documents are available online here or in-person from the Capitol Hill library branch.

It was a close one. The department reported 84 successful hires in 2024 — one more officer than it lost. Monday, Mayor Bruce Harrell and city officials held a press conference with a bolder mood as officials say SPD’s hiring momentum has continued with 60 officers hired here through April: The 60 officers hired so far in 2025 are more than in the last three years at this point combined. This includes experienced officers who can get started working sooner, with as many lateral hires in 2025 as in the previous five years at this point combined, and as many re-hires as in the last three years combined. Separations are also below the last five years through mid-April. If current trends continue, SPD is on track to hire over 150 officers in 2025, which would be the largest total hires in any year in recent record. Harrell and new SPD Chief Shon Barnes said Monday that the hiring comes on the back of a continued influx of candidates with the department receiving 1,218 officer applications by the end of the first quarter this year, compared to 690 applications at that point in 2024. Harrell, in the early stages of his reelection campaign to keep his office at City Hall, placed the quarter year’s hiring turnaround in context of his administration’s efforts to reform the department and grow efforts like the city’s new Community Assisted Response & Engagement CARE crisis responders while also pushing back on cutbacks or downsizing of SPD despite growing budget gaps and revenue uncertainty for the city. “A well-staffed and well-trained police department is essential to effective public safety in Seattle,” Harrell said. “Our work to modernize recruiting and increase qualified applications is showing results through record hiring in 2025 – putting us on a path to restore Seattle Police Department staffing,” The mayor and City Council president Sara Nelson, also facing reelection, have pushed for a goal of growing SPD’s ranks from the just under 1,000 officers on patrol in 2022 to nearly 1,500 by 2027. CHS reported here on the hiring of former Madison, Wisconsin chief Barnes to lead SPD and his focus on recruitment and retention at the department though large initiatives and smaller issues like infrastructure investments to improve the work environment including smaller upgrades like new carpet and fresh paint. The signs of a turnaround come as Seattle Police officials late last year said the department’s ranks had fallen to the lowest numbers in 30 years as the Seattle City Council expanded a program that pays out a $7,500 hiring bonus to new recruits and boosts bonuses for so-called “lateral” hiring from other police departments to $50,000 as the Harrell administration said Seattle continues to face regional competition for officers. SPD also launched a new recruiting advertising campaign this summer featuring “cartoon versions of police officers in various heroic scenarios.” The campaign is part of a $2.5 million budget in 2025 for police recruitment advertising and marketing. The department has also vowed to improve its recruitment of women even as the city faces ongoing harassment litigation from the department under ousted Chief Adrian Diaz. Publicola reported this week on SPD’s struggles despite its commitment to the “30 by 30” pledge calling for a 30% female recruit class by 2030. Publicola reports that only five of the 60 new hires touted by Harrell Monday are women. Paying cops more is helping. Seattle ranked 29th in the region to start 2024 for base pay for its new recruits an issue the bonus program won’t address. The city and the Seattle Police Officers Guild arrived at a new contract last spring that boosted pay 23%. The city says new recruits now start at a $103,000 a year salary with a $7,500 hiring incentive, and qualified lateral transfers from another agency start at $116,000 with a $50,000 incentive. SPD also says its “average hiring process for police officer candidates” has been streamlined from 5-9 months to 3-5 months. “On average, it takes about a year after graduating from the academy for recruits to become a Seattle Police Officer working an assigned patrol beat,” the city’s report on the hiring success said. Police officer candidates must be at least 20.5 years of age, have a high school diploma or GED equivalent, be generally physically fit, and be able to obtain a Washington driver’s license. There is no upper age limit to apply. In 2023, a 62-year-old joined the force. Monday, officials pointed at citywide crime totals that they say show encouraging public safety trends. CHS reported this month on those totals for the East Precinct that showed Capitol Hill and the Central District have been left out of the rest of city’s dip in reported property crime. East Precinct Violent Crime Report Totals East Precinct Property Crime Report Totals To start 2025 as he begins his campaign for a second term leading the city, Harrell has held up the turnaround in hiring as a key accomplishment of his administration. So far, Harrell’s most significant political challenge has emerged from his political left where progressive activist Katie Wilson is building her campaign around her work leading the Transit Riders Union and minimum wage and renter rights campaigns around the region.

Challenger Katie Wilson seems to have a top-two result all but wrapped up. “This woman is so smart, she’s kicked my ass so many times in so many debates,” repeat mayoral candidate Joe Mallahan said Tuesday night during a candidates forum focused on District 3 issues organized by the Leschi Community Council, the Central Area Neighborhood District Council, and the Coalition of Immigrants Refugees and Communities of Color. Mallahan’s admission — he’s currently running third in fundraising in the race with $122,000 in campaign contributions plus another $15,000 from an independent expenditure committee — made it pretty clear he knows Wilson is going through to November’s General Election. Wilson and incumbent Bruce Harrell’s campaigns have both reported raising around $450,000 each. Harrell is also backed by a $200,000 “Bruce Harrell 4 SeattlesFuture” independent expenditure committee. “We have great values here in Seattle but we often fail to live up to them,” Wilson said Tuesday night in her pitch to the crowd inside Leschi’s Grace United Methodist Church as she positioned her leadership as a collaborative and active effort to push beyond current City Hall leadership’s moderate leanings. Wilson promised an administration that would be more aggressive in galvanizing the city against federal cutbacks and attacks on DEI programs. She said she would back efforts to civilianize more of the work currently saddling the Seattle Police Department, expand alternative responses like the CARE crisis responders, and fix the city’s “broken” police accountability system. And she said she would lead in unity with the city’s community organizations and labor unions — “I’m a believer in the power of organization,” Wilson said. The progressive organizer who is the executive directors of the Transit Riders Union and helped lead minimum wage and renter rights campaigns around the region won the endorsement of the 43rd District Democrats last month. Tuesday night, Harrell “had another appointment and couldn’t move his schedule,” forum organizers told the crowd. In 2021’s primary, voters in Leschi and this area of the city were strong supporters of the Central District born and raised candidate. Harrell’s absence might have been to his advantage. The mayor did not have to respond to the role former T-Mobile executive Mallahan has settled into of Harrell basher with hopes of somehow henpecking the incumbent into third place and out of the race. “I believe the city of Seattle is badly mismanaged,” the repeat mayoral candidate said during one of his times at the microphone, calling Harrell a “disrespectful, vindictive, finger-pointer of a mayor.” You can watch the full candidates forum here.

KUOW reported new details this week from a 1996 incident where the then 37-year-old lawyer working in Nebraska pulled a gun on a man and a woman in a dispute over a parking spot at an Iowa casino. “We was like, ‘What the hell is going on?!” the woman, who was eight months pregnant at the time, told KUOW recalling the incident 30 years later. “It scared us.” KUOW broke the story on Harrell’s 1996 arrest in February but the new reporting provides perspective from the couple on other end of the dispute and details how the case was dismissed and never addressed as Harrell rose at City Hall as a member of the city council and then Seattle’s mayor. The small incident made news at the time, KUOW reports, because Harrell had been appointed to a housing authority board in Omaha. Harrell admitted to “displaying a gun” but said it was because of death threats he received after the appointment. After he was arrested and booked in the gun incident, KUOW says Harrell removed his name for consideration for the board. The case, however, was eventually dropped. Harrell’s spokesperson told KUOW this week the mayor was the victim. “In some ways, this was an introduction to the hostilities the mayor would receive as a public servant, and reminiscent of the treatment and bigotry he has received throughout his life as a biracial person by people of all races and backgrounds who see him as different,” the spokesperson told KUOW. The spokesperson told KUOW Harrell hired a law firm in 1996 “to write to the casino that Harrell’s constitutional rights were violated because of ‘unreasonable search and seizures based on racial profiling'” but no lawsuit was filed. The controversy over the incident is tempered by time and distance but will be another talking point in the 2025 election season. CHS reported here on the challenges Harrell and other Seattle incumbents face standing strong against the Trump administration while also not attracting vindictive attention from Washington D.C. Harrell is shaping his reelection campaign with themes around “common values,” “public safety solutions,” and “proven leadership to stand up for our values.” So far, his field of challengers is limited to candidates with little or no political experience in the city. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

Tuesday night’s Young Democrats at UW Candidate Forum will be broadcast online. Check out @youngdemocrats_uw for details and links. Seattle’s 2025 races for mayor, city attorney, and three seats on the city council will involve Seattle’s wall of mostly moderate Democrat incumbents facing challenges from the left — and a few from the right. One Capitol Hill-based political opponent to Mayor Bruce Harrell won’t be taking him on in the primary. Broadway boutique-owner and Republican neighborhood activist Rachael Savage has opted to file to be part of the race to challenge Alexis Mercedes Rinck for her citywide Position 8 seat on the city council. CHS asked Savage about the change after months of fundraising built around her planned challenge to Harrell. The mayor’s race has drawn eight other challengers to Harrell, however. CHS reported here on the campaign launch earlier this year for progressive activist Katie Wilson who has worked with organizations like the Transit Riders Union, and helped lead minimum wage and renter rights campaigns around the region. On the other side of the spectrum, business friendly candidate and former T-Mobile executive Joe Mallahan is back for a reheat more than a decade after he and Mike McGinn knocked incumbent Greg Nickels out in the city’s 2009 primary. McGinn, of course, battled with Mallahan over things like the plans for the First Hill Streetcar but went on to easy victory that fall. The Savage campaign says the arrival of Mallahan in the race signaled its exit, saying the “last minute entry of millionaire candidate into the race changed the math.” Now, the Savage campaign folks say they have a “winnable race” lined up for the council.

Wednesday marked the cutoff date for policy bills from the opposite house of origin to pass out of committee, but the pace (and the drama) will increase as the next few weeks of session unfold. Things are already getting spicy. Gov. Bob Ferguson doubled down this week against a new wealth tax, saying he would not sign either budget proposal passed by Senate and House lawmakers relying on such a tax to patch the estimated $16 billion shortfall over the next four years. That is leading the Democrat-controlled majorities in both chambers to rethink their proposals, and will require them to make some tough decisions in the coming weeks. Other tax proposals by Democrats, including taxes for Washington’s largest companies and adjusting the state’s 1% cap on property taxes, are still on the table as lawmakers continue to negotiate a final budget. Ferguson declined Tuesday to say which of those proposals, if any, he supports. Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, continue to rally against any new tax increases, including a gas tax increase for transportation projects. The next cutoff for fiscal bills to get voted out of their respective committees is Tuesday. After that, remaining bills must be passed by April 16 before they are considered dead for the year. Lawmakers will then spend the final 11 days of the session to concur on bill amendments made in each of the chambers, and to pass a balanced two-year budget.

But sometimes it has to move. A day center for homeless and other struggling people reopened in a new space last week after city officials threatened to shut down the center’s old location for violating a law that prohibits street-level social services on certain downtown blocks. Rather than continue operating from a former coffee shop on Rucker Avenue, Hope ‘N Wellness is now using a Cedar Street building owned by Our Lady of Hope Catholic Church. The homeless-aid organization was facing a closure deadline of April 30 on Rucker Avenue until the church stepped up to help, so the solution is a huge relief, executive director Jasmine Donahue said. “It’s like 5,000 pounds just came off my shoulders,” she said Wednesday as Hope ‘N Wellness participants sipped coffee in metal folding chairs in the new space. At the same time, Donahue harbors mixed feelings about the move, because it means the city has succeeded in pushing Hope ‘N Wellness out of a spot with a community feeling where vulnerable people felt safe, she said. “Shoving people out doesn’t help them recover or grow,” Donahue said. Officials began pressuring the homeless center to close more than a year ago, citing complaints about loitering and camping on Rucker Avenue. They said the city’s social services ban is supposed to make downtown Everett more vibrant by creating “synergistic opportunities” for shops and restaurants. Hope ‘N Wellness supporters pushed back this winter, accusing officials of trying to spruce up the area for development by pushing homeless people and drug users out. Similar debates have flared in other Puget Sound cities struggling to revive their downtowns in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. “With the great need for social services and support locally and throughout the region, we are glad Hope ‘N Wellness found a new location,” Nichole Webber, a spokesperson for the city, said in an email this week. Hope ‘N Wellness provides free coffee, food, hygiene supplies and clothes to people coming off the streets. The center is also a place to rest, make phone calls, get counseling and meet with case managers. You don’t have to be sober and don’t have to share your whole name to spend time there. Donahue didn’t know about the city’s downtown land-use law when she founded Hope ‘N Wellness during the pandemic and didn’t hear from city officials about the law until December 2023. They initially gave her an October 2024 deadline to close or move, then extended the deadline more than once. The Rucker Avenue space was located near Everett’s library, jail and courts, and the landlord was giving Hope ‘N Wellness a discount on rent, so finding a comparable new location was challenging, Donahue said. Salvation came when Donahue heard from Dennis Kelly, a deacon at Our Lady of Hope. The church had previously talked to the city about hosting a day center in its Cedar Street accessory building, Kelly said. That plan got stuck in bureaucracy related to public funding, but the idea lingered, he said. “They’ve been wanting to do this and needed staff to run it,” Donahue said. “We’re already running it and we needed a place. It worked out perfect.” The Cedar Street building is located just outside downtown Everett, so it’s convenient for Hope ‘N Wellness participants without violating the city’s law. The center was operating one day per week on Rucker Avenue and will continue with that schedule for now, with more days possible later. The church’s bright, airy building will take some getting used to for Hope ‘N Wellness. It’s not homey like the Rucker Avenue space, which had art everywhere. But a number of participants showed up Wednesday morning, crossing a hardwood floor to grab snacks and charge their phones. Michael McCoy, who’s been homeless for a year, walked a mile to reach the center. Kevin Lanting, who’s recovering from addiction, rummaged through a bin of donated clothes, picked out a purple University of Washington shirt and launched into an analysis of the UW football team’s budding talents. “It’s a blessing to have this resource,” he said. “Everyone is welcome here.” Although Our Lady of Hope won’t impose religious requirements on Hope ‘N Wellness participants, the center’s services align with the church’s values, said Kelly, the deacon. The church serves Monday dinners to homeless people out of the building on Cedar Street and has a food bank there, too. “If Jesus were here today, what would he want us to do?” Kelly asked, explaining why the church got involved. “We serve people on the margins.” Donahue said she had a good feeling about the arrangement partly because the church’s name and her organization’s both contain the word “hope.” “It was meant to be,” Kelly said. “That’s the way we look at it.”",2025-04-07T10:00:00-07:00,"['homeless', 'development', 'homeless (title)']",4.0,2025-07-30T14:22:49.375228,4790
