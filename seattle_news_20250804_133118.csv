In her own self-mythos, Nelson portrays herself as a departure from “[y]ears of performative, ideological decisions” to “delivering real results – prioritizing safety, livability, and a city that works for everyone, not just political theater,” as she said in a press release. That schtick worked for her in 2021 when she ran as a referendum to the previous City Council, which had earned a reputation for taxing big business, protecting tenants, expanding workers' rights, and somewhat addressing the concerns raised by the Black Lives Matter protests in 2020. But in just three years, Nelson transformed from the council’s political outsider to its ring leader. Now, after the reactive voting public overwhelmingly rejected her protégé, Tanya Woo, in favor of progressive Council Member Alexis Mercedes Rinck, Nelson now faces the challenge of defending numerous instances of her own “performative, ideological decisions” and “political theater” against an inevitable backlash candidate. That candidate has yet to emerge, but when they do, they’re welcome to reference this incomplete list of times Nelson made a little song and dance of her pro-cop, pro-business ideology. Who needs a study when you have vibes: In her first months on the City Council, Nelson introduced a resolution “supporting the development” of an incentives program that aimed to attract new officers to the Seattle Police Department (SPD). A resolution —or a non-binding action by the council—is by definition “performative.” And, in true “ideological” fashion, she didn’t let inconvenient information slow her largely symbolic crusade. The Seattle Department of Human Resources (SDHR) found inconclusive results regarding the efficacy of hiring bonuses. In particular, SPD did not see an increase in applicants even with the City dangling thousands in front of them at the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022. The department even appeared to caution against hiring bonuses as it could make current employees feel undervalued, leading to more departures. In an April 2022 committee meeting, Nelson encouraged her colleagues to dismiss the City’s findings — “This is one area where we don't need a consultant, really, to study the benefit of incentives,” she said. Instead, she pushed for immediate implementation of the policy, despite lacking evidence that it would effectively boost staffing levels. With little influence on the body, she couldn’t do much more than that. But lucky for her, she had a powerful ally in Mayor Bruce Harrell — at least when it came to cops. In July 2022, Harrell announced his plan to allow SPD to dole out hiring bonuses of up to $30,000 for lateral hires and $7,500 for new recruits. Later that summer, the City Council approved a hiring incentives pilot program. More than two years later, the City remains about 500 officers short of their decidedly unpragmatic goal of a force of 1,400 during a national staffing shortage. According to KOMO, despite the hiring bonuses, SPD lost 40 officers and gained only 15 in the first six months of 2024. Nonetheless, the council renewed the incentive program this year, even increasing the bonuses for lateral hires to $50,000. Nelson does a little interference as a treat: In July 2022, Nelson took a firm stance against former Council Member Andrew Lewis’s move to put Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) on the ballot next to an initiative for approval voting —a relatively untested system that seemed designed to favor moderates and establishment normies. Nelson, in a written statement and on the dais, accused the council of “interfering” with the will of the people in a rushed, opaque process. At the time, one could speculate that she made such a scene because she supported approval voting over RCV, but she insisted her vote against adding RCV to the ballot actually symbolized a vote for “good governance.” That principled stance crumbled when earlier this year lefties gathered enough signatures to put a tax on corporations to fund social housing on the ballot. Nelson folded, joining her council colleagues in supporting a pro-business alternative, drafted up in a suspicious process that could leave the council vulnerable to recalls. The curtain closed on Nelson’s outrage about good governance over council interference — No encore. An unsupportive supporting character: During budget negotiations in 2022, Nelson misrepresented the opinion of LaNesha DeBardelaben, the then president and CEO of Northwest African American Museum (NAAM), in order to further her own agenda. Nelson argued against an amendment to reroute $500,000 from the SPD advertising budget to NAAM for desperately needed repairs, claiming the DeBardelaben told her in a phone call that she was “disappointed” the funding would come at the expense of the cops. DeBardelaben told The Stranger that Nelson “egregiously misconstrued” their conversation. “I would never go against any amendment that invests $500,000 into the Northwest African American Museum,” DeBardelaben told The Stranger at the time. “... NAAM is a cultural gem for children, for elders, for families, for artists, for the constituents of all city council members, and for everyone.” And why would she misrepresent DeBardelaben? Nelson never answered The Stranger’s request for comment, but it seems pretty clear she used DeBardelaben to bolster a defense around her police maximalist agenda. Seems ideological to me! Grandstand: In the world of political theater, Nelson might deserve a Tony nomination for the following performance. In 2022, Nelson joined with former Council Member Alex Pedersen, another conservative outlier, in a symbolic vote against the 2023-2024 budget. This was despite the fact that the two received basically everything they wanted in the package, especially when it came to cops. The budget increased police funding from $355 million to $370 million, fully funded the Mayor’s ambition to hire 120 additional officers, and allocated $4 million in hiring bonuses. Since the budget’s passage was already assured,, “performative” seems an apt description of their little stunt. It drips with irony when you consider how conservatives like Nelson accused former Council Member Kshama Sawant of epitomizing “performative” and “ideological,” stances yet both Nelson and Pederson mirrored Sawant’s long standing practice of casting symbolic votes against the budget —something Pedersen himself had previously criticized. This one’s dedicated to the Downtown Seattle Association: After the State moved to recriminalize drugs in 2023, the City Council had no obligation to enshrine such a law on the City level, but Nelson, in partnership with Republican City Attorney Ann Davison, decided to anyway. She forced – and rushed – a mostly redundant virtual signal to carceral interests such as the Downtown Seattle Association (DSA), which was hungry to put drug users in jail where they would be, temporarily, out of sight and out of mind. The dramatic affair became a wedge issue in the 2023 campaign and may have been the nail in the coffin for Lewis’s re-election campaign. But did it solve so-called “street disorder?” Apparently not to the council’s own standard.his year, the new conservative majority marked new Stay Out Of Drug Area (SODA) zones to banish those charged with drug crimes in an effort to spread street disorder around so as not to offend Seattlites and tourists with the jarring sight of poverty and the public health crisis. Ritual sacrifice: In her first two years, Nelson had limited ability to do anything beyond the symbolic without help from the Mayor. But the tables turned after the 2023 election filled City Hall with her political allies who elected her council president over two more experienced members, Council Members Dan Strauss and Tammy Morales. Despite running in 2021 as a “pragmatic progressive” and leaning on similar branding in her re-election launch, Nelson’s first move as Council President did not fit the criteria for either “pragmatic” or “progressive.” She fired head of central staff Esther Handy, a highly unusual and shocking move that, while within her purview as president, flew in the face of pragmatism, according to City Hall insiders. And, those insiders couldn’t help but see a political motive in the firing. Handy, who served effectively under both progressive and conservative council presidents, still carried progressive stink on her from her time working at Progress Alliance and Puget Sound Sage. Nelson then replaced Handy with then Director of the Office of Economic and Revenue Forecasts (OERF), Ben Noble, who seemed to better align with her ideology as a proponent of fiscal austerity. Grab the popcorn: When conservatives bemoan “political theater,” they're often calling for civility, which usually boils down to keeping your volume down and avoiding personal attacks on colleagues. However, Nelson took part in one of the most scandalous personal attacks on Morales, which eventually led to her resignation. The council had to fill an open seat when former Council Member Teresa Mosqueda left the body for the County Council earlier this year. Disregarding the will of the voters, the council voted to appoint Tanya Woo, immediately following her loss to Morales. Morales took offense to the appointment, viewing it as a decision influenced by the majority’s corporate donors. She called the appointment a “foregone conclusion,” reducing the public process to little more than a puppet show. Adding to the insult, the council’s choice of someone who had actively campaigned against Morales felt like a deliberate slight—especially as Morales was already isolated as the sole member outside the conservative bloc. How I wish we had the full footage: Nelson's flair for the dramatic resurfaced in February 2024 when she couldn't help but accuse left-leaning public comment regulars, namely Stop The Sweeps, of exploiting the plight of refugee families to advance their own anti-surveillance agenda, as if the two issues couldn’t be directly and clearly connected. Her evidence? A few Instagram infographics urging people to sign up for public comment on Tuesday to support demands for housing and to oppose ShotSpotter. She called the show of solidarity “craven political opportunism” and limited public comment to just 20 minutes as punishment for the behavior. Surprise, the move backfired. Public commenters got pissed and staged an impromptu protest since Nelson denied them the official channels through which to levy concerns. The ordeal ended in six arrests and an hour and a half delay, meaning it would have actually saved time and some heat from the press to listen to her constituents rather than silence them. But the spectacle of publicly airing your personal beef with activists and eventually throwing them in jail is probably more satisfying. Cliffhanger: Despite her new power, Nelson’s biggest political endeavor of the year petered out without explanation, calling into question her characterization as a politician who “delivers real results” instead of engaging in virtue signals to her corporate overlords. Nelson embarked on a dramatic crusade against the newly established gig worker minimum wage earlier this year. But after a huge backlash from organized labor and ethical concerns that jeopardized her anti-worker majority, she gave up the fight and we haven’t heard a peep since. One might also characterize the ordeal as theater because she claimed to have conducted stakeholding with both sides of the debate. However, the group she cited as representing workers' interests was, in reality, an organization aligned with Uber's agenda. Cyberbully (2011) starring Emily Osment City Council: Most recently, her council came under fire after Morales announced her upcoming resignation in a scathing press release that accused her colleagues of bullying her, undermining her legislation, and eroding the institution as a whole. Addressing cultural issues like these are all of the council members’ responsibility, especially the council president. Although Nelson denies it, she failed to create an environment where everyone could reasonably do their job for their constituents. Instead, she allowed, without public pushback or apology, the City Council to openly scold Morales on the dais, stunts that reinforced to both Morales and the public the new power dynamics on the council. I’m sure I missed some of Nelson’s not-so-pragmatic and not-so-progressive moments during her tenure on the council and I’m almost positive we’ll see more theatrics before election day, but 10 examples seem like a good enough counter argument to her self-branding. Behind the scenes, politicos speculate Nelson will struggle to win this election. According to a poll by Northwest Progressive Institute conducted earlier this year, only 22% of likely voters approve of Nelson’s job performance and 32% said they disapproved. Her disapproval rate ranks even higher than Woo’s, who lost spectacularly to newcomer Rinck. As I reported following Rinck’s blowout win, Washington Community Alliance (WCA) data analyst Andrew Hong chalks up the pendulum swing to Rinck to a uniquely reactionary voting public that holds an anti-incumbent bias rather than progressive ideals newly awoken between the 2023 election and the 2024 election. Nelson’s consultant, Ben Anderstone, echoed Hong’s analysis in November, arguing voters who went center in 2023 picked Rinck in 2024 for “not-especially-ideological reasons.” “Seattle City Council never really stopped being unpopular,” Anderstone said previously. Anderstone, who did not want to speak directly about his client, said incumbents are not destined to lose, “but any incumbents need to effectively message around [voter’s] frustrations.” Nelson, in her press release announcement, acknowledged there’s still work for the council to do. ""Seattle isn’t where it needs to be yet, but we’ve come a long way. We’ve shifted from failed policies to approaches that are starting to work, and I’m committed to seeing those efforts through,” she said. ""By the end of this next term, I want our residents and people nationwide to know Seattle turned an impossible situation around by tackling tough issues and playing to its strengths.”",,"['mayor', 'city council', 'election', 'candidate', 'governance', 'harrell', 'bruce', 'davison', 'lewis', 'morales', 'mosqueda', 'nelson', 'pedersen', 'sawant', 'strauss', 'bruce harrell', 'ann davison', 'andrew lewis', 'tammy morales', 'teresa mosqueda', 'sara nelson', 'alex pedersen', 'kshama sawant', 'dan strauss', 'budget', 'housing', 'police', 'SPD', 'policy', 'development', 'referendum', 'legislation', 'nelson (title)', 'sara nelson (title)']",87.0,2025-08-04T13:23:38.314930,14411
https://www.thestranger.com/news/2024/12/24/79839693/mayor-harrell-seems-unbeatable-because-his-old-political-opponents-arent-trying-to-beat-him,The Stranger,Mayor Harrell Seems Unbeatable Because His Old Political Opponents Aren’t Trying to Beat Him Just Can't Get Enough?,"Mayor Bruce Harrell recently announced his bid to keep his job as “CEO of Seattle,” aiming to break a nearly 15 year curse in which no Seattle mayor has secured a second term. Despite several high profile departures during his tenure, Harrell has managed to avoid scandals as damaging as those that ended the careers of his predecessors—Ed Murray’s child sex abuse allegations and Jenny Durkan’s missing texts. But now, even in a historically precarious office, the interests that once sought to keep business-backed Harrell out of power, namely organized labor, aren’t currently scouting for a challenger in this election. It’s still early. While the powers that be seem cool with Harrell so far, there’s still time for a strong, pro-worker candidate to emerge before the filing deadline in May. Such a candidate's presence could call into question some progressives' newfound faith in Harrell and force him to answer for his record on not only labor, but housing, homelessness, and public safety. The candidates for the 2021 mayoral race fit neatly into the two familiar lanes of Seattle politics — Harrell represented business, while his opponent, then-City Council President Lorena González, represented labor. The same business interests that paid for Durkan and Murray’s campaigns coalesced around Harrell, spending almost $700,000 in support of him and another $650,000 against Gonzalez, according to the Seattle Ethics and Elections Commission. And it seems Harrell has kept big business happy. “Mayor Bruce Harrell’s first term has left our community – including the employer community – feeling very optimistic!” says president and CEO of the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce Rachel Smith. Smith cites the Chamber’s latest Index report, which found Seattle voters rated their quality of life and optimism higher than in previous reports. According to Smith, this marks the largest increase in these metrics in the report’s history. Remember, the Chamber doesn’t endorse candidates—they swore off directly organizing PACs after a PR fiasco in which Amazon nakedly tried to buy the 2019 election. But the same donors who supported the Chamber’s previous PACs still pool their money under different banners every year. Still, Smith says, the Chamber believes the increase in optimism “shows that Mayor Harrell’s leadership—leadership that is pragmatic, progressive, and focused on getting the basics right—is moving the city in the right direction.” Smith continues, “Coupled with managing the city budget, helping our community and businesses thrive by addressing public safety and drug use, and seizing opportunities that will benefit the city and region, we’re excited about working with him in 2025 and beyond. In other words, he’s kicking ass.” On the other hand, labor unions may have changed their tune from Harrell’s last election. In 2021, more than 20 progressive unions including UFCW 21 (now UFCW 3000), SEIU 775, Unite Here! Local 8, and the MLK Labor Council endorsed Gonzalez. Unions spent about $440,000 to support her and another $460,000 against Harrell through the Essential Workers For Lorena PAC, SEEC reports. But this time around, labor doesn’t seem so stoked to put up a million dollar fight against Harrell. The reason appears two fold—PACs have limited bandwidth to support candidates and organized labor thinks Harrell’s done an okay job. Next year, Seattle voters will weigh in on not only the Mayor’s race, but the City Attorney's race, two Citywide council seats, and now, the newly vacated District Two seat. Out of the two main, moneyed powers that decide local elections, big business has far superior buying power than labor. And so far, Progressive People Power (P3) PAC has yet to realize its promise of serving as a fundraising supplement to labor— most of its money in the recent election came from SEIU 775. Labor must choose its battles carefully. UFCW 3000 Secretary-Treasurer Joe Mizrahi says that right now, labor is much more focused on finding someone to run against Council President Sara Nelson, but he’s still interested in who might jump in the Mayor’s race in the coming months. So far, SEIU 775 Secretary-Treasurer Adam Glickman says that he hasn’t heard of labor scouting a challenger for Harrell. Labor’s been cozying up with Harrell for some time. In May, MLK Labor Council honored him with a “Labor Oscar” as reward for his “excellent leadership in reaching a deal with the Coalition of City Unions, his support of ‘first-in-the-nation’ workers rights laws in Seattle… his work to ensure that there was a landmark Labor Harmony Agreement on the Seattle Waterfront,” and his “leadership” in passing Building Emissions Performance Standards legislation that will help create hundreds of union jobs. “So we haven’t started an endorsement process yet in the Mayor’s race,” says Glickman. “But I can say that we really appreciate how the Mayor has repeatedly stood up for low wage workers against efforts by this council to undermine labor standards.” He referenced Nelson’s attempt to repeal the gig worker minimum wage and Council Member Joy Hollingsworth’s now-retracted bill to permanently enshrine a tip punishment system. While organized labor has credited Harrell with squashing the council’s attacks on workers’ rights, he never publicly opposed the gig worker minimum wage repeal. And he only called the sunset of the tip punishment system the “right thing for wage fairness” months after Hollingsworth had already withdrawn her bill. This is also the same Mayor who offered City workers a measly 1% raise, tried to strike human service cost-of-living adjustments, proposed cuts to the Office of Labor Standards, and faced accusations of trying to influence the City’s wage theft investigation at the Royal Esquire Club, a private social club where he served as board chair. But the lack of fire under labor’s ass to replace Harrell is not the only indication that Harrell has carved a wide lane for himself in his reelection campaign. Elected officials who previously endorsed Gonzalez have already come out in support of Harrell, including U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal, the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) Chair, and State Sen. Joe Nguyen, once dubbed the “AOC” of the Washington State Legislature. Nguyen did not respond to my request for comment. Jayapal calls Harrell a “great partner” to her and her office. She tells The Stranger: “He made a concerted effort to work with me on ensuring we bring the maximum amount possible of federal funding to Seattle for projects that have helped to build more affordable housing, support transportation and infrastructure, and to fight climate change. Mayor Harrell has also been a partner to me in pushing back on the MAGA extremist characterizations of Seattle, and helped me push the facts about how our city is a diverse, welcoming, and progressive place to live and work.” That’s not to say Harrell’s doesn’t have challenges. While he enjoys a relatively high approval rating—43% approval rating in a poll by the Northwest Progressive Institute—he’s also somewhat associated with Republican City Attorney Ann Davison and Nelson, as they ran on a pseudo joint slate in 2021 and have aligned on various issues in recent years. Neither Davison nor Nelson has nearly the popularity, scoring 27% and 22% approval rates respectively in the same poll. Davison has not announced her bid for reelection, so he may not have her baggage to deal with, but Nelson announced her's earlier this week. Harrell’s campaign did not respond when I asked if he plans to endorse Nelson. Additionally, Harrell’s pissed off other, less powerful interest groups in his tenure. Urbanists have criticized Harrell for his lackluster and slow-rolling Comprehensive Plan and lefties have criticized his zeal for sweeping the unhoused and his coziness with the cops. Those groups often align with labor, so if they can produce a strong challenger, the solid foundation Harrell seemed to roll out on may start to fracture.",,"['mayor', 'mayoral', 'city council', 'seattle politics', 'election', 'candidate', 'harrell', 'bruce', 'davison', 'nelson', 'gonzalez', 'bruce harrell', 'ann davison', 'sara nelson', 'budget', 'housing', 'homelessness', 'transportation', 'public safety', 'infrastructure', 'legislation', 'mayor (title)', 'harrell (title)']",58.0,2025-08-04T13:23:38.319974,8018

It was a close one. The department reported 84 successful hires in 2024 — one more officer than it lost. Monday, Mayor Bruce Harrell and city officials held a press conference with a bolder mood as officials say SPD’s hiring momentum has continued with 60 officers hired here through April: The 60 officers hired so far in 2025 are more than in the last three years at this point combined. This includes experienced officers who can get started working sooner, with as many lateral hires in 2025 as in the previous five years at this point combined, and as many re-hires as in the last three years combined. Separations are also below the last five years through mid-April. If current trends continue, SPD is on track to hire over 150 officers in 2025, which would be the largest total hires in any year in recent record. Harrell and new SPD Chief Shon Barnes said Monday that the hiring comes on the back of a continued influx of candidates with the department receiving 1,218 officer applications by the end of the first quarter this year, compared to 690 applications at that point in 2024. Harrell, in the early stages of his reelection campaign to keep his office at City Hall, placed the quarter year’s hiring turnaround in context of his administration’s efforts to reform the department and grow efforts like the city’s new Community Assisted Response & Engagement CARE crisis responders while also pushing back on cutbacks or downsizing of SPD despite growing budget gaps and revenue uncertainty for the city. “A well-staffed and well-trained police department is essential to effective public safety in Seattle,” Harrell said. “Our work to modernize recruiting and increase qualified applications is showing results through record hiring in 2025 – putting us on a path to restore Seattle Police Department staffing,” The mayor and City Council president Sara Nelson, also facing reelection, have pushed for a goal of growing SPD’s ranks from the just under 1,000 officers on patrol in 2022 to nearly 1,500 by 2027. CHS reported here on the hiring of former Madison, Wisconsin chief Barnes to lead SPD and his focus on recruitment and retention at the department though large initiatives and smaller issues like infrastructure investments to improve the work environment including smaller upgrades like new carpet and fresh paint. The signs of a turnaround come as Seattle Police officials late last year said the department’s ranks had fallen to the lowest numbers in 30 years as the Seattle City Council expanded a program that pays out a $7,500 hiring bonus to new recruits and boosts bonuses for so-called “lateral” hiring from other police departments to $50,000 as the Harrell administration said Seattle continues to face regional competition for officers. SPD also launched a new recruiting advertising campaign this summer featuring “cartoon versions of police officers in various heroic scenarios.” The campaign is part of a $2.5 million budget in 2025 for police recruitment advertising and marketing. The department has also vowed to improve its recruitment of women even as the city faces ongoing harassment litigation from the department under ousted Chief Adrian Diaz. Publicola reported this week on SPD’s struggles despite its commitment to the “30 by 30” pledge calling for a 30% female recruit class by 2030. Publicola reports that only five of the 60 new hires touted by Harrell Monday are women. Paying cops more is helping. Seattle ranked 29th in the region to start 2024 for base pay for its new recruits an issue the bonus program won’t address. The city and the Seattle Police Officers Guild arrived at a new contract last spring that boosted pay 23%. The city says new recruits now start at a $103,000 a year salary with a $7,500 hiring incentive, and qualified lateral transfers from another agency start at $116,000 with a $50,000 incentive. SPD also says its “average hiring process for police officer candidates” has been streamlined from 5-9 months to 3-5 months. “On average, it takes about a year after graduating from the academy for recruits to become a Seattle Police Officer working an assigned patrol beat,” the city’s report on the hiring success said. Police officer candidates must be at least 20.5 years of age, have a high school diploma or GED equivalent, be generally physically fit, and be able to obtain a Washington driver’s license. There is no upper age limit to apply. In 2023, a 62-year-old joined the force. Monday, officials pointed at citywide crime totals that they say show encouraging public safety trends. CHS reported this month on those totals for the East Precinct that showed Capitol Hill and the Central District have been left out of the rest of city’s dip in reported property crime. East Precinct Violent Crime Report Totals East Precinct Property Crime Report Totals To start 2025 as he begins his campaign for a second term leading the city, Harrell has held up the turnaround in hiring as a key accomplishment of his administration. So far, Harrell’s most significant political challenge has emerged from his political left where progressive activist Katie Wilson is building her campaign around her work leading the Transit Riders Union and minimum wage and renter rights campaigns around the region.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/07/17/80152628/hot-rat-summer-gets-its-own-media-stunt,The Stranger,Hot Rat Summer Gets Its Own Media Stunt Just Can't Get Enough?,"The sun beat down on the Capitol Hill gatehouse structure as the temperature slunk toward 90 degrees. Pigeon behinds butted over the lip of the building’s roof, pooping with abandon. A person named Bug stood on the small walkway jutting into the park’s reflecting pool and scraped at one of the arched windows, attempting to free Seattle’s new favorite art piece, a guerilla mosaic known as Saint Rat or Hot Rat Summer, from the prison of paint slapped on by the maintenance team at Seattle Public Utilities (SPU). Another person, Cyanasen (the unofficial custodian of the saintly rat), kept watch while smoking a joint. “I come here daily. I hang out with the rat wall and I clean up a lot of stuff and help maintain it,” Cyanesen says. (She says the mosaic is different from Saint Rat, a familiar graffiti tag around town. She calls it Hot Rat Summer.) No one can say exactly when, but sometime last summer a mystery artist cemented the mosaic of a rat standing in profile on multi-hued green grass, a flaming heart near its paw and a halo behind its head, onto the SPU building. Beneath its feet, under the grass, on a background of fire, are the words “Hot Rat Summer.” Seattle University art history professor Ken Allan writes that the piece “refers to Byzantine mosaic tradition in a fun way” and “the use of architecture nicely echoes this.” (Allan told The Stranger that he wants to examine Hot Rat Summer in person and will send more thoughts.) The public loves Hot Rat Summer. It’s a celebration of weird Seattle, of life in the city. Tripadvisor now lists it as a thing to do. The trans community particularly loves the piece. Rats are downtrodden, rejected by society, and harmed for being what they are. That resonates, Cyanesen says. Yet, since the mosaic's (immaculate) conception, the city has waged holy war against it. According to Cyanesen, the rat steward, the city has painted over the piece “eight or nine times,” which Hot Rat Summer enjoyers have scraped off again and again. This battle has seemingly come to an end. After the most recent rat erasure, a public commenter dressed as Saint Rat/Hot Rat Summer showed up to City Hall. City Council Members Joy Hollingsworth and Alexis Mercedes Rinck announced they would personally remove the paint covering the art. At around 2:00 p.m. Wednesday, Rinck and Hollingsworth arrived with a Lowe’s bucket filled with supplies and a ladder to do a job already well underway. Bug had been scraping for an hour and a half, and would stay hours after others left (at 5:30 p.m., Bug was still scraping). And before Bug got there, a “different guy” had put paint stripper on the wall. “This is a beautiful expression about what this neighborhood is all about and this neighborhood has been through it recently,” Rinck says. “These are dark times. Let the people have rats.” Rarely does anything this gold stay in a city hellbent on eradicating unsanctioned public art. Seattle City Council recently passed a law that both raises fines against frequent graffiti taggers to $1,500 and allows the City Attorney to bring civil penalties against them. Rinck was the only one on the council to vote against it. According to Rinck, whether or not this mosaic is different from the graffiti the current mayoral administration and city council majority hates is, like art, subjective. But the only one who can make that determination is Mayor Bruce Harrell, she says. However, it seems like City Attorney Ann Davison and the city council get their say as well. Davison proposed this new graffiti crackdown initiative, but only asked for $1,000 fines. The council’s Public Safety Committee, which includes Bob Kettle, Rob Saka, Joy Hollingsworth, Council President Sara Nelson, and Vacant (the ghost of Cathy Moore), were not satisfied with that sum. It was too low. In the committee meeting, Saka said he proposed his amendment to raise the fine to $1,500 “to make [taggers] hurt financially.” It passed out of committee. Saka and Kettle voted for it, while Hollingsworth and Nelson abstained. Hollingsworth, who voted to pass the bill with the increased fine, says the legislation won’t apply to Hot Rat Summer because it’s public art and “very different from tagging.” “This isn’t someone’s name,” Hollingsworth says. “This is a mosaic.” She then explained what a mosaic was, which The Stranger knew, The Stranger was there. “It reminds me of a stained glass window.” There’s no distinction between mosaics and graffiti in the Seattle Municipal Code, where graffiti is defined as any “unauthorized markings visible from premises open to the public, that have been placed upon any property through the use of paint, ink, chalk, dye or any other substance capable of marking property.” In spite of that, Hollingsworth says she’s been supportive of “stuff like this” since she was elected. Rats? No, no, public art. Last year, she allocated $225,000 in the budget to fund a mural walk (not quite the same thing as a guerilla rat mosaic, but go off). But she says she plans on introducing new legislation that would designate certain city-owned spaces for people to make art. She also wants to repaint the Cal Anderson bathroom in the colors of the trans flag, which was painted to protest the Christian Supremacist rally at the park in May, and zhuzh up the Black Lives Matter memorial on Pine Street. Hollingsworth says Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) “came and covered [Hot Rat Summer] up” multiple times without the council’s knowledge. The Cal Anderson gatehouse is its responsibility, not the responsibility of Seattle Parks and Recreation, which took heat for this. Ultimately, Hollingsworth blames bureaucracy for Hot Ratgate, both why SPU covered the mosaic and why nobody listened when she tried to raise the issue last year. She says she didn’t come out with a paint scraper and ladder because people are mad. She cares. Whatever her motivation, Hollingsworth says Hot Rat Summer is here to stay. “The Parks Department gave me their word, and so did the Mayor’s office, that they’re gonna send a crew out to restore this in the next couple days and professionally seal it,” Hollingsworth says. SPU won’t be fucking around with it anymore either. “Make sure you print this,” she says. “[SPU] have told me that they will do every window on here,” gesturing to the blank gatehouse windows “with some type of work from the community. And the city will pay for it because we’ll pay those artists.” There’s still one important question Hollingsworth wants to know. Who made Hot Rat Summer? Cyanesen just wants them to do a crow mosaic next.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/07/17/80153045/thousands-of-bruce-harrells-employees-endorse-his-opponent,The Stranger,Thousands of Bruce Harrell’s Employees Endorse His Opponent Just Can't Get Enough?,"This morning, in front of a small crowd of union members at City Hall, mayoral candidate Katie Wilson stood at a podium to accept an endorsement from PROTEC17. “I am so honored to receive the endorsement of PROTEC17, and so grateful to the thousands of city employees who have decided to put their faith in our campaign because they believe in our vision of what Seattle can be,” she said. A post shared by The Stranger 🗞 (@thestrangerseattle) The Working Families Party, the small but mighty progressive political party, spoke about why they were endorsing her. So did reps from UAW 4121 (graduate school workers), WFSE 1495 (state employees), the American Federation of Teachers (obvious, I hope), all of whom have already endorsed her. But PROTEC17 was the headliner. This isn’t Wilson’s first endorsement, or even her first labor endorsement. So why throw a press conference about it? Because PROTEC17 represents more than 3,000 city workers in Seattle—almost a quarter of the city’s workforce—which means this union is endorsing against their boss. This is the first time in recent memory that they’ve endorsed in the primary. At the press conference, Karen Estevenin, Executive Director of PROTEC17, expressed two concerns that define Wilson’s campaign: affordability and progressive revenue. Katie shares their union values, Estevenin said. “Katie overwhelmingly won our support with her concrete ideas, her doable plans to address these and many other issues that city workers and Seattle residents are facing,” she said. “PROTEC17 members, along with so many in this moment, are hungry for elected officials who can offer hope, who can offer inspiration, authenticity and a clear vision for a better world and the dogged tenacity to create it.” In a blue city whose politics is defined by labor and business, Wilson seems like a natural union choice. In the last decade and a half, she’s been one of the lead organizers in the campaigns to raise the minimum wage (in Seattle and Burien), make transit affordable (you can thank her for that unlimited low-income Orca Card), and protect renters (she helped cap late fees and move in fees). But this Spring, MLK Labor Council (our county’s Union of Unions, so to speak), endorsed Mayor Bruce Harrell. So did SEIU 775, the caregivers union and main funder of Seattle’s Progressive People Power PAC. The vote wasn’t unanimous, and several major unions reportedly abstained, but the endorsement got through. Katie Garrow, executive secretary-treasurer of MLK Labor, told the Seattle Times that they endorsed Harrell because he has a “proven track record of delivering real results for working people.” At the time, the “results” she pointed to were the city’s housing and transportation tax levies, and a new contract for the city’s unions that was more labor-friendly than expected. “Now, more than ever, blue cities like Seattle need experienced, strong elected leaders to uphold our values,” Garrow told the Seattle Times. That was back in May, though, when Harrell’s fundraising seemed like it was leaving Wilson in the dust and most of the city didn’t know her name. It was easier to consider Harrell’s reelection as a foregone conclusion. In July, they’re neck and neck. Both candidates have collected the maximum number of democracy vouchers they’re allowed to in the primary, and they’ve raised almost the same amount of money: Harrell has raised $449,980 and Wilson has raised $449,829. Wilson even has slightly more individual contributors—5,978 to Harrell’s 5,100. Outside of the feelings in the greater labor community, though, it’s no surprise that Harrell’s own employees might want a new boss. KUOW reported in March that, according to his niece (and senior deputy mayor) and six other women in City Hall, his administration is a misogynistic boys club, where women were condescended to and shut out of meetings in favor of white male advisors. Last year, PubliCola reported that the mayor’s office borrowed staff (and therefore budget lines) from other departments. The year prior, Harrell’s offered a 1 percent cost of living for essential city workers like electricians and librarians, while trying to coax rookie cops to join SPD with six-figure salaries and $30,000 signing bonuses, inspired workers to protest on the steps of City Hall. Today, Wilson stood with city workers in the same place. “I have been organizing alongside workers and labor unions for the whole of my career, because I believe deeply in the principle that lies at the very heart of the labor movement, solidarity.”",,"['mayor', 'mayoral', 'candidate', 'harrell', 'bruce', 'wilson', 'bruce harrell', 'katie wilson', 'budget', 'housing', 'transportation', 'SPD', 'harrell (title)', 'bruce (title)', 'bruce harrell (title)']",36.5,2025-08-04T13:23:38.321978,4564

Mayor Bruce Harrell’s office is explaining away his comments praising Elon Musk and other MAGA-aligned tech leaders last week while addressing the city’s business community at the annual “State of Downtown” gathering. “The mayor was not praising them, he was referencing they have an objective reputation as leaders in technology and innovation, and that it is a danger they are in the president’s orbit,” the mayor’s spokesperson told Publicola trying to explain the praise. “We know that our current president surrounds himself by some of the smartest innovators around,” Harrell said as he veered off script in his business-friendly speech at the Downtown Seattle Association event. “When we drop names like Andreessen or Peter Thiel or David Sacks or Elon Musk, these are smart innovators.” The nuanced praise for Musk in the shadow of his Department of Government Efficiency work to gut major areas of the federal government and his increased efforts supporting right wing campaigns around the globe comes as Harrell is shaping his reelection campaign with themes around “common values,” “public safety solutions,” and “proven leadership to stand up for our values.” With his job going up for a vote, the veteran Seattle politician does not seem interested at this point in engaging in extra tangles with the Trump administration — though his office said the mayor “certainly doesn’t agree with their politics” in the statement provided to media in the wake of last week’s Downtown Seattle Association speech. It will be a tricky row to hoe for Seattle leaders facing reelection in 2025. Monday morning, City Attorney Ann Davison, who ran for Lt. Governor as a Republican in 2020, released a statement calling Seattle a “Welcoming City,” avoiding the “Sanctuary City” label championed in past battles with Trump over immigration, as she announced Seattle will join San Francisco, Portland, “and many other jurisdictions across the country” in filing suit against the Trump administration over its threats to cut to cut federal resources to cities “that do not conduct federal immigration enforcement.” “It is not against the law to be a welcoming city. For more than 20 years, the City of Seattle, by ordinance, has directed its employees to not inquire about a person’s immigration status, absent a legal obligation to do so,” the Davison statement reads. “It is well within our authority to direct our employees in this manner.” Davison announced in January she would seek reelection joining public safety collaborators Harrell and City Council president Sara Nelson on the Seattle campaign trail. In the mayor’s race, meanwhile, none of the candidates lining up to oppose Harrell at this point have the mayor’s name recognition but one of them is being very straightforward in their approach to Making America Great Again. “Calling all MAGA Republicans in WA State. We need your help from outside the blue city,” Harrell challenger and Capitol Hill shop owner Rachael Savage pleaded on social media this week seeking financial support for her campaign. CHS reported here on Savage’s campaign launch as a Republican for the non-partisan mayor’s office as the candidate is promising to lead an end to “the addiction and mental illness epidemic” with a major crackdown in which the city’s police and prosecutors “arrest, charge and convict every person committing crimes on the streets of Seattle no matter how small those crimes are.” $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

Challenger Katie Wilson seems to have a top-two result all but wrapped up. “This woman is so smart, she’s kicked my ass so many times in so many debates,” repeat mayoral candidate Joe Mallahan said Tuesday night during a candidates forum focused on District 3 issues organized by the Leschi Community Council, the Central Area Neighborhood District Council, and the Coalition of Immigrants Refugees and Communities of Color. Mallahan’s admission — he’s currently running third in fundraising in the race with $122,000 in campaign contributions plus another $15,000 from an independent expenditure committee — made it pretty clear he knows Wilson is going through to November’s General Election. Wilson and incumbent Bruce Harrell’s campaigns have both reported raising around $450,000 each. Harrell is also backed by a $200,000 “Bruce Harrell 4 SeattlesFuture” independent expenditure committee. “We have great values here in Seattle but we often fail to live up to them,” Wilson said Tuesday night in her pitch to the crowd inside Leschi’s Grace United Methodist Church as she positioned her leadership as a collaborative and active effort to push beyond current City Hall leadership’s moderate leanings. Wilson promised an administration that would be more aggressive in galvanizing the city against federal cutbacks and attacks on DEI programs. She said she would back efforts to civilianize more of the work currently saddling the Seattle Police Department, expand alternative responses like the CARE crisis responders, and fix the city’s “broken” police accountability system. And she said she would lead in unity with the city’s community organizations and labor unions — “I’m a believer in the power of organization,” Wilson said. The progressive organizer who is the executive directors of the Transit Riders Union and helped lead minimum wage and renter rights campaigns around the region won the endorsement of the 43rd District Democrats last month. Tuesday night, Harrell “had another appointment and couldn’t move his schedule,” forum organizers told the crowd. In 2021’s primary, voters in Leschi and this area of the city were strong supporters of the Central District born and raised candidate. Harrell’s absence might have been to his advantage. The mayor did not have to respond to the role former T-Mobile executive Mallahan has settled into of Harrell basher with hopes of somehow henpecking the incumbent into third place and out of the race. “I believe the city of Seattle is badly mismanaged,” the repeat mayoral candidate said during one of his times at the microphone, calling Harrell a “disrespectful, vindictive, finger-pointer of a mayor.” You can watch the full candidates forum here.

The latest update comes after last year’s 84 hires as SPD eked out a small victory by bringing on one more officer than it reported losing. The press release from the mayor’s office touts the hundred-hire milestone but doesn’t include statistics on the department’s current ranks. CHS reported here in April as Harrell and new SPD Chief Shon Barnes said that improved hiring totals were being driven by an influx of candidates with the department receiving 1,218 officer applications by the end of the first quarter this year, compared to 690 applications at that point in 2024. The city’s data shows that applications fell slightly in the second quarter to just under 12 qualified applicants per day. The signs of a turnaround have continued as Seattle Police officials late last year said the department’s ranks had fallen to the lowest numbers in 30 years as the Seattle City Council expanded a program that pays out a $7,500 hiring bonus to new recruits and boosts bonuses for so-called “lateral” hiring from other police departments to $50,000 as the Harrell administration said Seattle continues to face regional competition for officers. SPD also launched a new recruiting advertising campaign this summer featuring “cartoon versions of police officers in various heroic scenarios.” The campaign is part of a $2.5 million budget in 2025 for police recruitment advertising and marketing. The department has also vowed to improve its recruitment of women even as the city faces ongoing harassment litigation from the department under ousted Chief Adrian Diaz. The starting salary for a SPD officer is now $103,000 for entry level recruits and $116,000 for lateral officers, Harrell’s office says. The mayor and City Council president Sara Nelson, also facing reelection, have pushed for a goal of growing SPD’s ranks from the just under 1,000 officers on patrol in 2022 to nearly 1,500 by 2027. Barnes, meanwhile, is holding a series of public safety community forums this summer. A date for a District 3 forum for neighborhoods including Capitol Hill, First Hill, and the Central District has not yet been announced. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

Harrell told the Council that an Office of Inspector General (OIG) report supported accusations that Diaz had a romantic relationship with an employee who he hired for a top position at SPD, and then continuously lied about the relationship. In the letter—which Harrell also sent to the City’s police accountability departments, and City Attorney Ann Davison—the mayor said that the OIG report showed Diaz had a romantic relationship with the employee, who he hired through an informal process for a position that had not existed at SPD for sometime, promoted the employee, discussed his sexual relationship with her with other members of SPD, and when confronted about it, denied the relationship existed. Harrell said in the letter that he discussed the findings of the report with Diaz on December 12. Diaz continued to deny a romantic relationship with the employee, but Harrell wrote that he found Diaz’s arguments unpersuasive against the evidence from the OIG: In addition to statements from other SPD employees who said Diaz had told them directly about his romantic relationship with the employee, the OIG investigation turned up a handwritten note from the employee that talked about their romantic relationship. A member of Diaz’s executive protection detail found the note while cleaning a car Diaz used, and the OIG brought in a handwriting expert who said, “it was highly probable,” the note was written by the employee. Given the evidence a romantic relationship between Diaz and the employee had taken place, Harrell found that Diaz’s statements denying the relationship to the Mayor, the public, and SPD command staff violated the department’s policies around dishonesty. Harrell also said that the OIG report found behavior that violated the department’s policies on professionalism, including making “crass and personal statements” about the employee while discussing the intimate relationship with other SPD employees. Harrell called the comments especially “egregious” because Diaz made these statements to his subordinates. Harrell further found Diaz violated policies around conflicts of interest and avoiding improper relationships between supervisors and their subordinates. In the December 12 conversation with Harrell, Diaz maintained that he’d only ever had a platonic relationship with the employee. He also attacked the credibility of witnesses as well as the thoroughness and objectivity of the investigation into his behavior. In particular, Diaz said investigators never reviewed his personal phone records. However, Harrell found Diaz’s arguments unconvincing and pointed out that Diaz had failed to turn over his phone records when an OIG investigator requested them. Diaz’s final departure from SPD comes after a drawn out process that started in May when Harrell demoted Diaz from his position as Chief of Police, leaving him in an amorphous special assignment while allowing him to keep his $370,000 salary. The demotion came amid a smattering of lawsuits accusing Diaz of a culture of racism and sexism at SPD, as well as rumors about his romantic relationship with a subordinate. About a month after his demotion, Diaz went on Jason Rantz’s conservative talk radio show and came out as gay, saying that, if he’d revealed his identity sooner, it might have helped him save his job. OIG opened an investigation into the hiring of the top aide around the time of Diaz stepping down as chief. Then in October, Diaz was placed on administrative leave. Shortly after that he filed a $10 million tort claim against the City. An attorney for Diaz did not immediately return a request for comment. In an email to staff Tuesday, Interim Chief of Police Sue Rahr said Harrell had handled the termination of Diaz and she had no other information to share about it. SPD directed all requests for information about the firing to the Mayor’s Office. In Harrell’s statement regarding the firing of Diaz, he acknowledged the lengthy investigation and called it “robust and thorough."" He added that he looked forward to announcing the City’s next police chief in the near future.",,"['mayor', 'city council', 'harrell', 'bruce', 'davison', 'bruce harrell', 'ann davison', 'police', 'SPD', 'mayor (title)', 'harrell (title)', 'bruce (title)', 'bruce harrell (title)', 'police (title)']",32.0,2025-08-04T13:23:38.321978,4282
https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/06/27/80120394/progressive-revenue-is-not-dead-in-seattle,The Stranger,Progressive Revenue Is Not Dead in Seattle Just Can't Get Enough?,"Seattle electeds have finally realized that they can’t simply rely on the Jumpstart Tax, a progressive (but fluctuating) payroll tax, to backfill budget shortfalls in perpetuity, and they are pursuing new progressive revenue options. I know, I know, this city council and this mayor finding new revenue methods? Our financial outlook is that bad. The Seattle Shield Initiative united an odd duo, Council Member Alexis Mercedes Rinck and Mayor Bruce Harrell. Together, they proposed the initiative to help alleviate the financial stress that a $251 million deficit across all fund balances—and Trump in the White House—will put on the city. The initiative will temporarily raise business and occupation (B&O) taxes to fund programs threatened by the Donald Trump administration, such as investments in housing vouchers, shelters, food and nutrition access, resources for survivors of gender-based violence, and affordable housing. But it gets better. The initiative doesn’t raise the B&O tax for all businesses, only some. Under the initiative, to help bolster struggling mom and pop shops, many small businesses will actually stop paying B&O tax. Sounds pretty good, right? Not if you’re part of a big business organization. The Downtown Seattle Association (DSA, but not the cool one) and the Seattle Chamber of Commerce have already poo-poo’d the proposed initiative. Jon Scholes, president and CEO of the DSA (derogatory) and frequent bad-opinion columnist at the Seattle Times, said in a statement that the Trump tariffs are already bad for business and city leaders are about to “make things worse on local companies” with this new tax. “This proposal is a tax on downtown Seattle’s revitalization and a self-inflicted wound to the progress we’ve been making to attract more businesses downtown and strengthen the city’s tax base. It will make it harder to fill empty tall office buildings and storefronts with companies, which will threaten the commercial tax base and shift more of the tax burden to residents,” Scholes wrote. The Seattle Shield Initiative will raise the B&O tax threshold exemption from $100,000 to $2,000,000 in gross revenue, which means 76 percent of small businesses won’t pay any B&O tax at all. Meanwhile, only businesses earning more than $2 million in revenue will have to pay a higher tax than they did before. According to a press release from the city, “approximately 90% of businesses would owe less than they do today.” Of course, that means those high-earners would shoulder the B&O tax. This is unfair, according to Scholes. “City leaders should heed the lessons from the past and reject boneheaded ideas solely concocted in the name of fighting President Trump,” Scholes wrote. “This rushed tax proposal is bad fiscal policy that will set Seattle back and raise costs for residents.” He had some big, weird feelings (“It’s the fiscal policy version of Seattle’s defund the police movement and if passed will ultimately result in Seattle defunding its tax base,” he wrote on LinkedIn. “This idea should be thrown in the trash bin next to the remnants of defund the police, CHOP/CHAZ, legalizing drugs, etc”) and I’m sure we’ll hear more from him in a forthcoming Seattle Times editorial. But, I must say, this is pretty funny outrage coming from the organization that just pushed policy through the Seattle City Council to put eyesore digital advertising kiosks on Seattle streets. The money earned from those kiosks will go right back into DSA coffers. Maybe they can use some of that money to help their struggling big businesses pay the B&O tax increase. In response to these comments, at a press conference, Harrell said, “We think it’s good policy, and we would disagree [with the DSA].” Remember, this is from longtime DSA (again, not the socialist one) ally Harrell. Do we… gotta hand it to him? “We are not trying to run business out of Seattle, we are open for business,” Harrell, newly anointed fan of progressive revenue (or just a man worried about being another one-term mayor), continued. “So as we look at dealing with a $250 million deficit… The fact is that the state legislature only gives us so many tools, and this is a tool we think along the lines of progressive revenue that is a smart policy to adopt...We will do everything possible to continue to have a healthy business environment, but we stand behind this policy.” In a statement to The Stranger, Mercedes Rinck said, ""It’s true. This proposal progressively shifts B&O tax burden to the largest businesses in Seattle. The top 10 percent will pay more, and the bottom and middle will pay less. I think we can all see that as a worthwhile investment in the local community, workforce, and economy. What will actually set Seattle back is doing nothing while thousands in our community are on the brink of food insecurity and homelessness due to draconian federal cuts."" Wealthy business owner gripes aside, this initiative is a boon for small businesses, according to Jeanie Chunn, community activist, longtime small business advocate, and current candidate for City Council District 2. Chunn, who helped engage small business owners on this initiative for Rinck's office, described how paying fewer B&O taxes will make a huge difference. Especially for businesses operating on the margins like restaurants, having extra funds could pay for much-needed new equipment, new benefits for employees, or repairs. The initiative will provide “much welcomed relief,” she wrote in an email. According to Chunn, most restaurants fall under the $2 million revenue threshold. Even for those who rake in over $2 million annually, they’ll still pay less in local B&O taxes than they do currently because “it's only on sales over $2M.” The Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce jumped to its usual excuses for the reasons we can’t raise taxes: It has some “interesting ideas,” but it’s “rushed,” and companies just can’t afford it right now. “I think the Chamber of Commerce's outrage over this initiative shows that they have and will always represent the interests of large corporations and not locally-owned businesses, small business owners, or the workers of Seattle,” Chunn wrote. ""If the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce only wants to advocate for the preferences of their Emerald and Platinum members, that is their prerogative,"" Mercedes Rinck told The Stranger. ""Local government has responsibility to step up in this moment, and our proposal gives Seattle residents that choice."" However, the Seattle Shield Initiative is not law yet. Rinck will need to curry favor with the other members of the council. They will have to vote on the initiative by Aug. 5. If it's approved, we the people will get to have our say in the November election.

(If you get to the end, there’s some butt jokes, as a treat.) Trump Is Afraid of Teachers: Last week, ICE arrested and detained Fernando Rocha, a theater manager at Juanita High School in Kirkland. His lawyer told the Seattle Times that Rocha entered the US on a tourist visa in 2018, and before it expired, he applied for asylum. The case is still pending. Meanwhile, ICE Seattle claimed on Twitter that Rocha was wanted in Brazil for theft, a claim that his family in Brazil called “outlandish.” Harrell Wants to Watch You Stumble Home Drunk: Or sunbathe in Cal Anderson. Or go to high school. Last week, Harrell and SPD Chief Shon Barnes claimed that the city’s pilot program for their Real Time Crime Center was a roaring success (ok, Batman). The surveillance program put CCTV cameras along Aurora Avenue North, the downtown Third Avenue corridor, and the Chinatown-International District, and integrated them with their favorite new Automated License Plate Readers into a super secret data center (it’s SPD headquarters). Barnes says they’ve assisted in 90 active criminal investigations in 60 days, but didn’t say what the investigations were (we asked and we’ll report back). Now, Harrell wants to do the same in Cal Anderson, the Capitol Hill Night Life District, and Garfield High School. What could go wrong?

Prosecutors say Sayre used his bar in Everett as a staging ground to prey on his victims. Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said in a statement that it was “one of the most complex and disturbing cases” the department has handled. Sayre’s attorney asked that he get 17 and a half years. The prosecutors asked for 133. Judge Millie Judge (not a typo) went with 109, citing the length and breadth of Sayre’s crimes. WA Child Welfare Isn’t So Well: According to the office that oversees the Department of Children, Youth, and Families, critical injuries for kids in the state’s welfare system took a huge jump in the first half of this year. By the end of June, at least 92 children had died or nearly died, up from 78 in the first six months of 2024. Some Republicans are trying to blame the bipartisan Keep Families Together Act, but fentanyl is the likelier culprit. So far this year, 20 of the cases involving kids under 4 years old were caused by accidental fentanyl exposure.

Sheriff T.K. Waters said the cellphone video doesn’t tell the full story. “Cameras can only capture what can be seen and heard,” he said at a news conference Monday. “So much context and depth are absent from recorded footage because a camera simply cannot capture what is known to the people depicted in it.” Don’t worry, T.K., it captured the racism just fine.

His lawyer told the Seattle Times that Rocha entered the US on a tourist visa in 2018, and before it expired, he applied for asylum. The case is still pending. Meanwhile, ICE Seattle claimed on Twitter that Rocha was wanted in Brazil for theft, a claim that his family in Brazil called “outlandish.” Harrell Wants to Watch You Stumble Home Drunk: Or sunbathe in Cal Anderson. Or go to high school. Last week, Harrell and SPD Chief Shon Barnes claimed that the city’s pilot program for their Real Time Crime Center was a roaring success (ok, Batman). The surveillance program put CCTV cameras along Aurora Avenue North, the downtown Third Avenue corridor, and the Chinatown-International District, and integrated them with their favorite new Automated License Plate Readers into a super secret data center (it’s SPD headquarters). Barnes says they’ve assisted in 90 active criminal investigations in 60 days, but didn’t say what the investigations were (we asked and we’ll report back). Now, Harrell wants to do the same in Cal Anderson, the Capitol Hill Night Life District, and Garfield High School. What could go wrong? Serial Rapist Sentenced in Everett: Christian Sayre, a former Everett bar owner, was sentenced to 109 years for 16 counts of second-degree rape, third-degree rape of a child, indecent liberties, and possession of depictions of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct. Prosecutors say Sayre used his bar in Everett as a staging ground to prey on his victims. Everett Police Chief John DeRousse said in a statement that it was “one of the most complex and disturbing cases” the department has handled. Sayre’s attorney asked that he get 17 and a half years. The prosecutors asked for 133. Judge Millie Judge (not a typo) went with 109, citing the length and breadth of Sayre’s crimes.

CHS first reported on the plan in December as Deputy Mayor Tim Burgess included the proposal during a public safety meeting with the neighborhood’s business community sparked by ongoing challenges around street crime and drug use around the Broadway-Pike/Pine core and Cal Anderson Park. Last week in a press conference to tout the success of SPD’s Real Time Crime Center, Harrell’s office said the mayor backs an expansion of a pilot program that already has cameras along Aurora Ave, 3rd Ave, and in the International District to include areas around Cal Anderson and Pike/Pine. The mayor’s office is also backing expansion of the 24×7 surveillance program to include the area around Garfield High School where the city and the district are spending thousands on security upgrades and community services to counter deadly gun violence that has marred the campus. Garfield is also being considered for a pilot program beginning this fall that would pay for a Seattle Police School Engagement Officer on the campus. The Harrell administration says it recently proposed legislation to the Seattle City Council that would expand “the geographic areas where City CCTV cameras can be installed, including public streets and sidewalks around Garfield and Nova High Schools, the Capitol Hill Nightlife District, and the SODO Stadium Area,” according to a statement from City Hall. “The legislation also authorizes the RTCC to view and record SDOT traffic cameras at select intersections and along major arterial roads in the city,” the mayor’s office adds. (Image: City of Seattle) The proposed expansion comes as Harrell and new SPD Chief Shon Barnes touted the early success of the RTCC and the pilot creating the new SPD surveillance system combining Closed-Circuit Television Camera systems above the city’s streets with “real-time crime center” software.after only two months of operation. The city says the new system “integrates various video and data streams for enhanced analysis and investigation of crime incidents.” Since its launch on May 20, the upgraded center has played a role in investigating 600 reported incidents and was currently supporting 90 active criminal investigations, officials said last week. According to the city, RTCC analysts provide patrol officers and detectives with incident details, video images, and other relevant information, “often as incidents are happening.” “RTCC analysts can communicate directly with officers in the field via police radio channels,” the city says. “During a recent gun violence incident near Aurora Avenue North, RTCC analysts used CCTV cameras to observe the shooting suspect, send an image of the suspect to responding patrol officers, and then advise officers of the escape route that the offender was taking.” SPD first rolled out the RTCC in 2015 funded through a $411,000 Department of Justice grant. The mayor hasn’t put a public price tag on the new upgraded capabilities of Seattle’s RTCC or the proposed surveillance camera expansions. The addition of the initial set of Aurora, 3rd Ave, and ID cameras was reported as $1.8 million. “Our Real Time Crime Center is already proving to be a vital tool in solving crimes and improving public safety across the city, supporting hundreds of investigations and accountability for dangerous offenders,” Harrell said in a statement. “By investing in and leveraging evidence-based technology, we’re giving our officers the resources they need to respond effectively while ensuring these tools are used responsibly and with strong safeguards. Public safety remains our top priority, and this initiative shows our commitment to creating safer neighborhoods for everyone in Seattle.” “Our Real Time Crime Center is already proving to be a vital tool in solving crimes and improving public safety across the city, supporting hundreds of investigations and accountability for dangerous offenders,” said Mayor Harrell. “By investing in and leveraging evidence-based technology, we’re giving our officers the resources they need to respond effectively while ensuring these tools are used responsibly and with strong safeguards. Public safety remains our top priority, and this initiative shows our commitment to creating safer neighborhoods for everyone in Seattle.” In the East Precinct, SPD has focused on drug issues and street disorder centered around Pike and Broadway and the area around Cal Anderson and Deputy Mayor Burgess’s renewed efforts sparked by neighborhood outcry — and a key email from a neighborhood developer — over an October murder on 11th Ave. (Image: City of Seattle) Burgess said earlier this year his office was working on a plan to add the area around Cal Anderson and Pike/Pine identified by SPD as a trouble zone for drug crimes and street disorder to the anti-crime camera system pilot being rolled out in the area around Aurora Ave N, the International District including Little Saigon, and the 3rd Ave corridor downtown. Other City Hall initiatives including one of its biggest haven’t made much of an impact. CHS reported here on the so far rarely used Capitol Hill Stay Out of Drug Area and the first recipient of a banishment order for the zone. Meanwhile, in the Central District, the 2024/2025 school year at Garfield High School began with new efforts around gun concerns at the 23rd Ave campus and across the city as Seattle officials led by Harrell announced a $14.5 million plan focused on intervention, mental health, and increased use of “school-based safety specialist” private security guards following the deadly lunchtime shooting of teen Amarr Murphy-Paine in June 2024 in the Garfield campus parking lot. The timeline for expanding the cameras to Pike/Pine and 23rd Ave is not clear as chair Bob Kettle must now move the legislation forward with the council’s public safety committee. Harrell, meanwhile, is engaged in a closer than expected race with challenger Katie Wilson as the August 5th primary approaches. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

https://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2025/05/seattle-police-clear-sunbathers-at-denny-blaine-park/,Capitol Hill Seattle,"CHS Capitol Hill Seattle News Seattle Police clear sunbathers at Denny Blaine Park — UPDATE: Mayor, Hollingsworth respond LATEST CHS SUBSCRIBER TOTAL: 1,236","Police were at Denny Blaine Sunday(Image: @mom_calls_me_myrtle) A police officer “on a premise” assignment at Denny Blaine Park caused a stir Sunday at the nude beach east on the shores of Lake Washington. The Seattle Police Department is apparently cracking down on the popular Capitol Hill sunny day getaway. Reports describe multiple police officers called to the scene Sunday telling afternoon park goers to cover up and trespassing one sunbather who refused, according to Colleen Kimseylove of the Friends of Denny Blaine Park community group that has been trying to find solutions that protect the park’s history and place in Seattle queer culture while also placating increasing hostile neighbors in the wealthy neighborhood that surrounds the nude-friendly beach and park that has been affectionately known as Dykiki for decades. “When Kimseylove arrived, they spoke to SPD Officer Ella Brooks who told Kimseylove that no Seattle law protects nudity, and if someone called and complained, SPD officers had to respond,” independent Seattle news site The Burner reports. “The cops also told Kimseylove that someone had directed SPD to routinely check in on the park. They told Kimseylove that people needed to put their clothes on or be trespassed or potentially arrested.” SPD reportedly told one sunbather who argued with officers Sunday they were banned from the park for the week. The department has not publicly provided details of the order. Seattle Parks, whose Park Rangers are authorized to formally trespass individuals for breaking park rules, says it issued no trespasses at the park this weekend. The police presence at the park began just before 2:30 PM Sunday when an officer checked in on East Precinct radio “on a premise” in Denny Blaine Park. Less than five minutes into the beat, she called in for a supervisor. While an officer reporting in “on a premise” can have multiple meanings, it typically indicates an officer is beginning a patrol at an assigned location. Officers check in this way, for example, when SPD is conducting emphasis patrols at specific locations like a school or a business. CHS asked SPD for more information about the incident that followed, the reported trespass, and the premise assignment but the department has not yet responded. The Burner reports it has been told that neighbors have also hired private security to keep watch on the park and deal with police. The apparent crackdown follows filing a lawsuit from unnamed park neighbors demanding the city address concerns at Denny Blaine over “public masturbation, public sex and other types of indecent exposure, drug use, unlawful public nudity, environmental damage to the shoreline, and scofflaw parking.” The suit all but ends any chance at goodwill and compromise the Friends of Denny Blaine group has been forging. The group has been meeting regularly to find community solutions that also protect the park’s place with queer and nudist communities. The friends group successfully pushed back in 2023 on a plan quietly shepherded by Mayor Bruce Harrell to add a children’s playground to the park with the help of a no longer-anonymous donation from Denny Blaine neighbor and Seattle mall developer Stuart Sloan. Sunday, meanwhile, is not the first time officials have tried to change behavior at Denny Blaine. Seattle Parks has tried here and there over the years to timidly suggest sunbathers cover up but never before with cops threatening arrest. Given the city and SPD’s silence on the matter so far, it may not be the last. Sunday’s weather was 60 F and breezy. Tuesday, highs are predicted to approach 80 F before a bout of rain hits the city this weekend. UPDATE: We’ve also reached out to District 3 representative and chair of the city council’s parks committee Joy Hollingsworth to learn more about what is being done to protect community use of the park and will update when we hear back. UPDATE x2: Hollingsworth declined to comment at this time. “Once we receive more information and facts, we will have a better understanding of the situation,” the council member said. UPDATE x3 5/7/2025 8 AM: Hollingsworth says she is “continuing to closely monitor the situation at Denny Blaine Park, particularly in light of the events that took place last Sunday.” In a statement posted Tuesday on social media, Hollingsworth, who is gay, said she recognizes “the deep significance of Denny Blaine to our LGBTQ+ community” and is “committed to preserving and protecting safe, inclusive public spaces for all.” Hollingsworth, chair of the council’s parks committee, says she has been in “active communication” with the Seattle Police Department, Seattle Parks and Recreation, and the Mayor’s Office about the Sunday enforcement, and expressed her concerns over the situation, “underscoring the need for a thoughtful, community-centered approach moving forward.” SPD’s enforcement efforts don’t seem to fit that approach. For now, Hollingsworth is still talking compromise. “My ongoing hope—and priority—is that we can collaboratively develop a solution that respects the park’s unique heritage while ensuring the safety, dignity, and well-being of everyone who visits,” she concludes. Katie Wilson, who is challenging incumbent Bruce Harrell for the Seattle Mayor’s office this year, also added her voice to the condemnation of SPD’s actions, calling the actions a seeming “Plan B” after efforts to change Denny Blaine like plans for the playground were scuttled. “As I’ve been talking with voters around the City, I hear again and again that people want a police force that is adequately staffed but also responsive, trustworthy, and accountable to the communities it serves,” Wilson said in her updates on social media. “It was jarring to read this story about Denny Blaine just after a grocery worker told me about nearly being stabbed on the job and then waiting a very, very long time for police to arrive. What are our priorities? Why are we sending police to harass harmless people hanging out at a queer nude beach?” “Of course, we know why,” she writes. “Because wealthy neighbors don’t want those people there. Just like they wanted the City to build a playground at Denny Blaine to drive them out. And Mayor Harrell’s administration was all set to oblige— until the community organized & pushed back.” “It’s hard to avoid the suspicion that this police prodding is Plan B,” Wilson said. “And it certainly sounds like this strategy is coming from the top. It is mind-boggling that with the multiple major challenges and crises our city is facing, this is what we’re doing.” Harrell, who said he shared “disgust” over the complaints of nudity and lewd behavior at the park in text messages revealed last year, has not yet publicly responded to the Sunday SPD enforcement at the park. UPDATE x4 5/7/2025 9:50 AM: In a statement, the his office say Mayor Harrell has not “directed a change to SPD patrols or approach to enforcement at Denny Blaine Park.” “As we’ve said before, Mayor Harrell recognizes that people have a right to use the park nude under State law,” a spokesperson said. The spokesperson told CHS the mayor’s office would need to “defer to SPD on the details of specific events or any individual enforcement actions taken.” SPD’s communications team has not replied to CHS’s previous inquiries about the situation. We have added them to our conversation with the mayor’s office. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

KUOW reported new details this week from a 1996 incident where the then 37-year-old lawyer working in Nebraska pulled a gun on a man and a woman in a dispute over a parking spot at an Iowa casino. “We was like, ‘What the hell is going on?!” the woman, who was eight months pregnant at the time, told KUOW recalling the incident 30 years later. “It scared us.” KUOW broke the story on Harrell’s 1996 arrest in February but the new reporting provides perspective from the couple on other end of the dispute and details how the case was dismissed and never addressed as Harrell rose at City Hall as a member of the city council and then Seattle’s mayor. The small incident made news at the time, KUOW reports, because Harrell had been appointed to a housing authority board in Omaha. Harrell admitted to “displaying a gun” but said it was because of death threats he received after the appointment. After he was arrested and booked in the gun incident, KUOW says Harrell removed his name for consideration for the board. The case, however, was eventually dropped. Harrell’s spokesperson told KUOW this week the mayor was the victim. “In some ways, this was an introduction to the hostilities the mayor would receive as a public servant, and reminiscent of the treatment and bigotry he has received throughout his life as a biracial person by people of all races and backgrounds who see him as different,” the spokesperson told KUOW. The spokesperson told KUOW Harrell hired a law firm in 1996 “to write to the casino that Harrell’s constitutional rights were violated because of ‘unreasonable search and seizures based on racial profiling'” but no lawsuit was filed. The controversy over the incident is tempered by time and distance but will be another talking point in the 2025 election season. CHS reported here on the challenges Harrell and other Seattle incumbents face standing strong against the Trump administration while also not attracting vindictive attention from Washington D.C. Harrell is shaping his reelection campaign with themes around “common values,” “public safety solutions,” and “proven leadership to stand up for our values.” So far, his field of challengers is limited to candidates with little or no political experience in the city. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

Maps and details of the proposed expansions were presented last week to the Seattle City Council’s public safety committee as the mayor’s office hands off legislation to expand the existing Real Time Crime Center camera pilot currently operating along Aurora Ave, 3rd Ave, and in the International District. “Analysts are supporting ongoing investigations by pushing video and incident data directly to patrol units and detectives,” a city council analysis of the proposal reads. “Analysts can also provide live updates and still images of suspects, a capability SPD says helps support its ‘precision policing’ model.” CHS reported last month on the proposal that would expand the 24×7 surveillance program while also expanding the overall program to allow SPD “to view and record SDOT traffic cameras at select intersections and along major arterial roads in the city.” The proposed SPD camera expansion would include adding the installations to the city’s Stadium District around Lumen Field and T-Mobile park. The city already operates more than 350 traffic cameras across its streets. SPD’s current three-location system includes 57 cameras, the city says. The proposed SPD expansion comes as Mayor Bruce Harrell and new Chief Shon Barnes have touted the early success of the RTCC and the pilot creating the new SPD surveillance system combining Closed-Circuit Television Camera systems above the city’s streets with “real-time crime center” software.after only two months of operation. The city says the new system “integrates various video and data streams for enhanced analysis and investigation of crime incidents.” Since its launch in May, the upgraded center has played a role in investigating 600 reported incidents and was currently supporting 90 active criminal investigations, officials said in July. According to the city, RTCC analysts provide patrol officers and detectives with incident details, video images, and other relevant information, “often as incidents are happening.” The Harrell administration says privacy concerns should be a matter of policy. Part of the legislation being proposed this summer would make changes in line with the city’s data retention policy that automatically deletes the files “30 days after date of recording, or until determined that no incident occurred that had evidentiary value.” The new “SPD-owned” cameras in any expansion would also be part of a mandated evaluation funded as part of the pilot program. The mayor’s office claims it has buy-in from community after “public engagement efforts included conversations between the Garfield-Nova neighborhood and the Seattle Public Schools.” “Camera installations for the Capitol Hill nightlife area were discussed at a community forum and through individual meetings with business leaders,” the city says. The proposed Capitol Hill boundaries would cover the core of the Pike/Pine neighborhood along E Pike and E Pine between Broadway and 12th Ave with a mapped extension along Nagle Place and Broadway north of the core all the way to Denny/E Barbara Bailey Way and the southern edge of Capitol Hill Station and its Sound Transit security camera installations. The camera zone would stretch to the backside of Pike/Pine along E Union. The Nagle extension would cover an area troubled by nighttime violence, camping, and street disorder and represents a de facto inclusion of Cal Anderson Park’s western edge including Bobby Morris Playfield and the skate area, dodgeball and tennis courts, and basketball court. The city hasn’t said if cameras would be installed in the park but any Nagle cameras would be in range of the park. In the Central District, the Harrell administration is pushing for the camera system to be centered around safety at Garfield High School but with boundaries running from a block north of the school along E Cherry all the way to S Jackson. The western edge would include 20th Ave and the eastern edge would extend along 26th Ave. The zone would include Garfield’s 23rd Ave campus, the Garfield Super Block area including the Garfield Community Center and sports fields, and the troubled parking lot at 23rd and Jackson. How the program handles private property like the 23rd and Jackson parking lot around businesses like AutoZone and Walgreens and public areas like the Garfield campus isn’t clear. The extension to Jackson would allow the SPD system to monitor the area around the Vulcan Real Estate-owned parking lot and surrounding area where multiple incidents of gun violence have erupted including this 2023 drive-by shooting that damaged a nearby daycare and sent one man to the hospital. The Capitol Hill system will cost around $400,000 to install and $35,000 a year to operate. The Central District installation has a budget of $425,000 and also an estimated $35,000 in “ongoing annual costs.” CHS first reported on the expansion plans in December as Deputy Mayor Tim Burgess included the proposal during a public safety meeting with the neighborhood’s business community sparked by ongoing challenges around street crime and drug use around the Broadway-Pike/Pine core and Cal Anderson Park. The mayor’s office is also backing expansion of the surveillance program to include the area around Garfield High School where the city and the district are spending thousands on security upgrades and community services to counter deadly gun violence that has marred the campus. Garfield is also being considered for a pilot program beginning this fall that would pay for a Seattle Police School Engagement Officer on the campus. The Capitol Hill and CD systems are currently not funded and will require a funding source to be identified. The mayor’s office says the $200,000 Stadium District expansion will be paid for out of the city’s 2026 FIFA World Cup spending. The proposed expansions come as Harrell and city officials say there has been a turnaround in Seattle Police hiring as they push for a goal of growing SPD’s ranks from the just under 1,000 officers on patrol in 2022 to nearly 1,500 by 2027. Meanwhile, crime stats show a downward trend for the city after spikes in reports of violent and property crime coming out of the pandemic. The council’s public safety community is expected to finalize debate and vote on the proposals at its meeting next week. $5 A MONTH TO HELP KEEP CHS PAYWALL-FREE🌈🐣🌼🌷🌱🌳🌾🍀🍃🦔🐇🐝🐑🌞🌻 Subscribe to CHS to help us hire writers and photographers to cover the neighborhood.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/03/07/79956841/dionne-foster-is-not-sara-nelson-so-who-is-she,The Stranger,"Dionne Foster Is Not Sara Nelson. So, Who Is She? Just Can't Get Enough?","On Monday, Dionne Foster announced her candidacy for Seattle’s citywide District 9 seat, challenging City Council President Sara Nelson. Foster is currently the executive director of the Washington Progress Alliance, an advocacy organization that helped push through the state’s new capital gains tax to fund education. While that’s a big, progressive win, it’s not her only policymaking experience. At one point in her long and varied career, she was a Senior Policy Advisor for the City of Seattle. Before making it to city hall, she worked her way through school in the restaurant industry, earned a Master’s of Social Work at the University of Washington, and did a bunch of nuts and bolts policy analysis for places like King County and Puget Sound Sage. She’s got a teenage son who does roller derby. In an interview, she listed her hobbies as doing standard PNW outdoorsy stuff (including Trailhead Direct) and taking him to roller derby. Cute! Given recent polling, plus decisive wins in recent elections for lefty progressive Alexis Mercedes Rinck and a proposal to fund social housing from the coffers of rich corporations, Foster stands a good chance of unseating Nelson. Besides the fact that the political pendulum is swinging back to the left (which is, depending on how hard you squint, where Foster sits), Nelson has not exactly made friends during her time in office. “I would vote for a rock if it ran against right-wing, drunkard millionaire Sara Nelson,” one Redditt user put it in response to Foster’s announcement. “Because even a rock would drag us down less than her.” Foster is not a rock, thankfully. She is a person with a pulse and has ideas about what to do with this beautiful, backward city of ours. So what are they and how do they differ from her opponent’s? Will they bring about the big, transformative changes needed to dig ourselves out of the housing and homelessness crisis we’re in? We used the word “specific” or some variation of it twelve times in our interview, but Foster artfully dodged any tangible policy commitments. When pressed for more details, she said, “I feel like as we continue through the campaign, I’d love to continue to share more specifics and say this exact thing or more details.” Similarly, in response to a list of yes/no lightning round questions sent post-interview (which included a bonus round asking for favorite local spots), she responded, “Really excited to get into these over the course of the campaign! Current food obsessions — Tailwind Cafe salted chocolate chip cookie & Ba Bar imperial rolls.” Sadly, we do not get any certainty on whether she agrees with the Mayor’s sweeps blitz or supports social housing. She’s right about the imperial rolls, at least, but we get the point: it’s just vibes for now. That said, her vibes on the issues of the moment — housing and homelessness — are generally good. On housing, she wants to “make sure that we have both abundant housing and affordable housing.” Again, no specifics, but she did say she thinks we can do more than is mandated by HB 1110, the state law that legalized fourplexes everywhere and six plexes on transit lines. “We should be doing more, and we should be making sure that Seattle is a place that leads on this,” she said. Foster has called out displacement as a major issue. She currently lives in South Seattle, which gives you something of a front row seat to it. What would she do to combat it? She cited down payment assistance and subsidized artist housing as keeping her and her co-parent, respectively, here in the city. Regarding housing, she said we need to “execute our plan well” when it comes to growth, and “think about ways to protect our neighborhood centers.” Sounds good! Foster is excited to roll out a comprehensive policy as she moves further into her campaign. “I think right now, really wanting to make sure that I'm introducing people to me, my values, and how I think about the issues that we're facing.” Okay, okay, we get it! But what about transportation? She lives a short walk away from a light rail station, and uses it when she doesn’t have to drive her kid to roller derby practice over in White Center. Thanks to that lateral commute, plus her co-parent’s old route to work, which involved the #50, Foster is acutely aware of the lack of east-west transit in the South End. And, again thanks to the #50, just how long it can take to get places on Seattle transit. Breaking with her no-specifics theme, she did call out some action items for pedestrian and bike safety: better lighting, more crosswalks, and traffic calming. She’s also got lived experience on this one, having been the victim of a very low-speed hit and run on Rainier Ave S. We don’t love that she had to live that experience, but we do love that she knows what it’s like for walkers out here. On cops, we have nothing extraordinary to report. We didn’t chat about it much, but like every politician in this city, she’s in favor of hiring more cops. She also has written the infamous “hire more women guards” meme into her platform. Oof. But she’s in favor of building out the CARE team, our alternative response program, and addressing “root causes” of crime. That’s about the best we’re gonna get from anyone these days. We also briefly touched on climate. She said she was, “really proud to get to be a part of the entire Defend Washington team last year, which included making sure that we could protect the state Climate Commitment Act and the resources that flow from the Climate Commitment Act.” Besides that, she shouted out transit-oriented development as a good strategy to reduce car trips and by extension lower emissions, but didn’t offer anything else in terms of specific policy proposals. Overall, Foster emphasized that she’s a person who focuses on results. As she told both Publicola and us, she wants to “get shit done.” In a city plagued by endless, intractable processes, that’s music to our ears. We also love that she’s someone who takes the train and has worked for an hourly wage sometime in the last ten years. Can’t say that about most of the current council. However, she also already displays a politician’s natural affinity for polite vagaries and plausible deniability. While people are very bummed about most of the shit the current council has done, doing nothing also sucks.",,"['mayor', 'city council', 'nelson', 'foster', 'sara nelson', 'housing', 'homelessness', 'transportation', 'policy', 'development', 'nelson (title)', 'foster (title)', 'sara nelson (title)']",27.5,2025-08-04T13:23:38.317969,6352

Tuesday night’s Young Democrats at UW Candidate Forum will be broadcast online. Check out @youngdemocrats_uw for details and links. Seattle’s 2025 races for mayor, city attorney, and three seats on the city council will involve Seattle’s wall of mostly moderate Democrat incumbents facing challenges from the left — and a few from the right. One Capitol Hill-based political opponent to Mayor Bruce Harrell won’t be taking him on in the primary. Broadway boutique-owner and Republican neighborhood activist Rachael Savage has opted to file to be part of the race to challenge Alexis Mercedes Rinck for her citywide Position 8 seat on the city council. CHS asked Savage about the change after months of fundraising built around her planned challenge to Harrell. The mayor’s race has drawn eight other challengers to Harrell, however. CHS reported here on the campaign launch earlier this year for progressive activist Katie Wilson who has worked with organizations like the Transit Riders Union, and helped lead minimum wage and renter rights campaigns around the region. On the other side of the spectrum, business friendly candidate and former T-Mobile executive Joe Mallahan is back for a reheat more than a decade after he and Mike McGinn knocked incumbent Greg Nickels out in the city’s 2009 primary. McGinn, of course, battled with Mallahan over things like the plans for the First Hill Streetcar but went on to easy victory that fall. The Savage campaign says the arrival of Mallahan in the race signaled its exit, saying the “last minute entry of millionaire candidate into the race changed the math.” Now, the Savage campaign folks say they have a “winnable race” lined up for the council.

Now we’ll see if Rachael Savage is also an environmentalist. Washington’s Department of Ecology may be wandering into a neighborhood hornet’s nest as it begins the public process on the Stewart House Cleanup Site under its affordable housing grant program. The DESC and the department are entering into an agreement on a state funded cleanup of the site where decades of waste from oil furnaces has accumulated. The Belmont Ave properties home to a trio of former transitional housing buildings from Pioneer Human Services were acquired in a $6.5 million deal last year as the DESC made plans for a new 120-unit apartment building with onsite services for its residents on the block. A 30-day public comment period on the cleanup agreement ends at midnight on May 6th. “Many communities in Washington are facing a housing crunch, but one Ecology program is helping to ease the shortage,” the state’s announcement of public comment window reads. “Our Affordable Housing Cleanup Grant Program provides grants to developers to help clean up contaminated sites. In return, the developers redevelop the property, with at least 40% of the square footage slated for affordable housing for at least 30 years.” The documents from the agreement are posted here. “The properties have historically been the site of apartment buildings heated by oil furnaces. Soil at the cleanup site has been contaminated by petroleum products that leaked out of underground storage tanks,” the state says. “The extent of the contamination will be studied during the future remedial investigation phase.” The state grant process around the projects has been streamlined by the legislature. In 2022, the permanent program was established to provide the grants for planning and cleanup of contaminated sites intended for affordable development. But the process adds another wrinkle to the DESC’s plans in the neighborhood. CHS broke the news on the project this fall as the organization confirmed its planning for “a new Permanent Supportive Housing project” on the parcels it purchased over the summer. King County’s program to fund the projects says permanent supportive housing is housing “for a household that is homeless on entry, where the individual or a household member has a condition of disability, such as mental illness, substance abuse, chronic health issues, or other conditions that create multiple and serious ongoing barriers to housing stability.” City permitting is already approved to demolish the vacant buildings to make way for the new 120-unit DESC permanent supportive housing project. An August fire mostly destroyed one of the buildings waiting to be torn down. Belmont DESC will serve people earning 30% and 50% of Area Median Income who are experiencing chronic homelessness. DESC says its tenants usually earn about 9% to 12% of AMI. The Belmont building will feature only studio units and is being designed for single adult residents. Opposition to the project includes residents and building owners who say the area is already overburdened by the challenges around halfway houses and housing programs for at-risk populations. Broadway business owner and Republican candidate for mayor Rachael Savage made opposition to the plan an early foundation of her “Savage Citizens” campaign. “Capitol Hill already has over three hundred people housed in multiple buildings that operate on this model variously called Housing First, Permanent Supportive Housing or Low Barrier Housing,” Savage said “Our streets are in chaos. We have done enough.” Environmental appeals have become a regular aspect of the long delays faced by development projects around Seattle and, especially, in the city’s largest, most important decisions. CHS reported here as appeals including cases representing Madison Valley, Mount Baker, Hawthorne Hills, and “73 remaining Southern resident killer whales” have gummed up Seattle’s efforts to meet state zoning requirements and arrive at a new 20-year growth plan for the city. The Department of Ecology program, meanwhile, has already been at work in Seattle where a grant-boosted cleanup cleared the way for The Maddux, an affordable project from the Mt. Baker Housing organization just off Rainier. In 2018, the state awarded Mt. Baker Housing $400,000 to start assessing the cleanup project. The legislature later awarded another $6.2 million to finish the project. The cleanup began in June 2020 and took five months to complete. The corner had previously been home to a dry cleaner and gas station. An initial state report on the Stewart House site was completed in 2018. “The presence and/or condition of groundwater has not yet been assessed at the site,” the state’s updated reporting reads. The Department of Ecology is holding a hybrid in-person and virtual “open house” on the project on April 15th. Documents are available online here or in-person from the Capitol Hill library branch.

In exchange for Dave admitting to the citation, agreeing to pay a $5,000 fine, and attending driving school, the Seattle City Attorney’s Office (CAO) asked the court to waive a 90-day license suspension for Dave. The killing of Kandula garnered international headlines after the body-cam video of Seattle Police Officer and police union Vice President Daniel Auderer cackling at her death became public. The Seattle Police Department has since fired Auderer, and Dave’s discipline for his involvement in Kandula’s death is pending. Auderer has since filed a $20 million lawsuit against the city. At Wednesday’s hearing, Seattle Municipal Court (SMC) Judge Noah Weil accepted the negotiated settlement between the City and Dave, but added a condition for Dave to complete 40 hours of community service. The penalty guidelines for negligent driving allow for a judge to require up to 100 hours of community service, but Weil noted that as a law enforcement officer Dave “does contribute to the community.” “But I do want to recognize the impact this offense has had on the community as well, and so I’m going to require 40 hours of community service,” Weil said. Dave has 30 days to pay his $5,000 fine and about nine months to fulfill the court-ordered conditions of his sentence. Under the agreement with prosecutors, he can avoid a license suspension as long as he commits no new criminal traffic offenses over the next year and complies with all his other sentencing conditions. Dave’s attorney did not immediately return a request for comment. CAO spokesperson Tim Robinson pointed The Stranger to the court records and said the CAO's office handled Dave's case like any other charge of negligent driving in the second degree with a vulnerable person. Robinson is correct that similar charges often result in no license suspension and, in some cases, the CAO may dismiss the ticket, even when a pedestrian’s death is involved. However, Dave’s position as a police officer shielded him from facing more serious charges, as state law permits officers to exceed the speed limit while responding to emergency calls. Earlier this year, the King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office (KCPAO) declined to charge Dave with a felony vehicular homicide in the death of Kandula. Their investigation determined that on January 23, 2023, Dave hit Kandula while traveling at about 63 miles per hour as she crossed in a crosswalk at the intersection of Dexter Avenue North and Thomas Street in South Lake Union. Seconds before Dave saw her crossing, he hit speeds of up to 74 miles per hour in a 25-mile-per-hour zone. Dave attempted to break a second before hitting her. Investigators concluded that had Dave traveled at speeds closer to 50 miles per hour, he could have avoided hitting Kandula. After hitting her, Dave began CPR. The KCPAO found they could not charge Dave as they could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he “consciously” drove with “reckless disregard for the safety of others.” After the KCPAO declined to prosecute, they bounced the case back to the Seattle Police Department, who referred the case to the CAO’s office as a citation. With Dave’s court penalties basically wrapped up, he still awaits a disciplinary decision from SPD connected to the killing of Kandula. In early November, the Office of Police Accountability concluded its investigation into Dave, finding he violated SPD’s policies around driving and not breaking the law, but Interim Chief of Police Sue Rahr has yet to decide on final discipline for Dave. Since Kandula’s death, Publicola has uncovered extensive examples of Dave’s poor driving history and a previous firing from another police department, all of which SPD knew prior to hiring him.",,"['municipal', 'davison', 'ann davison', 'police', 'SPD', 'davison (title)', 'ann davison (title)', 'SPD (title)']",17.0,2025-08-04T13:23:38.321978,3910

Saying what needs to be said, what others are afraid to say, is exactly her brand and the point of The Bitchuation Room. The Los Angeles-based Fiorentini calls Gaza’s genocide a genocide and urges her audience to do the same, roasts popular progressive podcasts like MeidasTouch for ghosting the topic entirely, lambests the human embodiment of the Daily Mail comment section, Piers Morgan, to his face for his hypocrisy, and challenges the left to not just repeat what’s popular but “to make popular what we need said.” It’s that fearlessness that has given her Fran-tifa faithful (as she calls her fanbase) the rare, iconoclastic mix of wit, rage, and clarity nearly extinct from political comedy podcasts. The manospheric Theo Von has to break out a dictionary just to define the word “convene.” In addition to her work with Al Jazeera, Fiorentini rose to popularity as a contributor on the long-running, once-progressive internet news show The Young Turks (TYT). After nearly a decade of keeping it relevant, she walked away in March 2025 when it started flirting with “bridge-building” with MAGA. True to form, she called out what she saw as capitulations to conservatism, saying TYT founder Cenk Uygur was, “acting like a bitch.” Uygur responded with a self-indulgent half‑hour video explaining why he was “removing” her from the network. Fiorentini has happily moved on. Her fans stayed loyal to her. Not only for her politics, but her defiant, necessary gallows humor that helps wring a few ounces of joy from weeks when the news cycle itself feels like the best case against humanity. She’s not the left’s Joe Rogan (she has 250k subscribers to his 20 million) and won’t be. She’s unwilling to cuddle up to the powerful or compromise with fascists. I don’t believe in role models, yet she manages to be mine, and one to so many others. With headlines feeling like a daily descent into the abyss, Fiorentini has been a steady reminder that though these times may be grim, we don’t face them alone. And although the left may not need more podcasters, it sure as hell needs more Francesca Fiorentinis: voices willing to cut through the noise with courage, clarity, and an unshakable refusal to surrender integrity. You can catch the one and only this Saturday at the Rainier Arts Center in Columbia City, where she’ll be taping a live episode of The Bitchuation Room alongside Ijeoma Oluo, mayoral candidate Katie Wilson, and comedian Derek Sheen. She spoke to The Stranger about why the left needs to loosen up, the fragile idiocy of billionaires, the crackdown on adversarial media, and what it would take to finally build a progressive media ecosystem that’s both sustainable and fearless. [This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.] What made you hop up I-5 and bring your show to Seattle from LA? You’ve got a strong following, but why here? Obviously, I’m here to reboot CHAZ—sorry, CHOP. I’m calling it Frantifa, which is what I call my followers: radicals who also like to laugh. Seattle’s always had a reputation for culture and politics, so it made sense. And honestly, if we’re gonna survive fascism, we need a front that’s politically sharp and culturally fun, inclusive, and inviting. We’ve sold out shows in Chicago, Brooklyn, San Francisco, Portland—Seattle was overdue for some love. I love grounding the show in the city we’re in, which means pulling in local activists, artists, comedians, even elected officials. That’s why I’m thrilled mayoral candidate Katie Wilson is joining us. In Chicago we had Rosana Rodriguez, a DSA-backed alderwoman. In Brooklyn, Tiffany Cabán. In L.A., we featured Eunisses Hernandez, an organizer turned councilmember. It’s about bringing all these threads together: politics, culture, comedy, and real strategies for surviving all the shit we’re up against. On your show you’ve called out even “progressive” outlets for neutering their politics or chasing clicks. Sometimes, as you’ve noted, Joe Rogan says more about Palestine than so-called progressive media. Where does The Bitchuation Room fit into this mess? Look, I don’t want to be the Rogan of the left. Gross. Joe Rogan is a bona fide idiot. But it’s true: a lot of media left of center is either watering down its politics or chasing clicks that end up fueling the right. I want The Bitchuation Room to be neither. I want the comedy and political analysis to be radical, unsafe—in a good way—and intersectional. Not “edgy” as in punching down or dropping slurs. Edgy as in: “abolish ICE.” “Defund the police.” “Free Palestine.” I’m tired of just reacting to Rogan, Andrew Schulz, Theo Von—whoever the right anoints this week. We need to build our own narratives. Calls to defund the police or reinvest in communities scared the establishment because they worked. Abolishing ICE is a real, winnable demand. These are headlines we should own, not let the right dictate. You were pioneering in the “new media” space years ago—doing podcasts, video, comedy, activism. But looking at the current landscape, with layoffs, streaming chaos, and the Colbert show gone—do you ever feel like the weary millennial auntie watching Gen Z hustle on TikTok? Oh, totally. The media industry right now is a dumpster fire. Private equity eats up outlets, merges them, lays everyone off. Streaming guts traditional networks. And suddenly, Colbert and 200 staffers are out of work. What happens? He’ll get a podcast. Great—I have a podcast too. But we’re all fighting for scraps in the same attention economy. Honestly, we need fewer podcasters and more revolutionaries. That’s what I try to do with The Bitchuation Room: platform actual movement leaders while keeping it funny. Because if media alone could save us, we’d be saved by now. Meanwhile, creators are handing over their content for free while Meta trains AI on it. At some point, we’re going to need a content strike—creators banding together for fair pay. With all that, what keeps you doing this work? You’ve got a two-year-old now. Life could be easier. I want the left to have a sense of humor again. To stop taking itself so damn seriously. We need spaces where we can talk about abolition, talk strategy, and still laugh. The right’s got comedians fawning over Trump and then turning on him when it’s convenient. Let them wallow. We need to build our own culture, our own joy. And it’s not just about jokes. Comedy that punches up can reveal truths the powerful want buried. That keeps me going. So does seeing new creators pop up—it gives me hope. And the truth is, the show is therapy for me. I can start an episode feeling like dog shit and finish it feeling a little less like dog shit. That community, even online, matters. You always sound grounded on the mic—even when the news is hellish. How do you stay sane enough to do it? Oh, I don’t. The news crushes me daily. But the show helps. It’s my therapy. I try to add something—an interview, a joke, a new angle—so it’s not just more doomscrolling. And I want to model irreverence. We can cry, rage, and still mock the Astronomer CEO and his HR girlfriend. We contain multitudes. Politically, that’s when we win too, when we stop pretending we have to be just one thing. What gives you hope that we can actually course correct as a society? Hope’s a stretch some days. I’m not as optimistic as I was at 18, protesting the Iraq War while it happened anyway. But I believe we don’t have to live like this. The billionaires running our lives? Fragile idiots. What we’re up against isn’t human nature—it’s structures, corruption, money. And structures can fall. The uprisings for Black Lives Matter and Palestine are signs of what’s possible. The powerful know it—that’s why they’re terrified. We just have to get Democrats out of the way long enough to fight. Some days, I fantasize about moving to Costa Rica. But I don’t want to look like I gave up. So I stay and fight. The Bitchuation Room LIVE will take place at the Rainier Arts Center at 8 pm (doors open at 7:30 pm) on Saturday, August 2nd.

Turns out, it’s not Seattleites. Next Tuesday, Seattle voters will finish voting on Proposition 1, our first shot at a social housing model. The original proposition—1A on your ballot—proposes a tax on businesses whose employees take home more than $1 million a year. That tax would fund the Seattle Social Housing Developer, which would acquire and build housing that would reliably serve Seattleites who make anywhere from 0 to 120 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI), while guaranteeing that everyone’s rent is 30 percent of their income. (We like this idea and think you should vote for it.) Unsurprisingly, the Seattle Chamber of Commerce isn’t stoked on a new tax on businesses and raised a campaign against it—1B on your ballot—which would attempt to pull from Jumpstart funds (which are already earmarked for entirely different types of low-income housing) and undermines the funding model that makes this social housing so unique. The campaign for 1B has been very visible, especially in our mailboxes, with oversized mailers covered in claims that it’s “for the rich,” or quotes alongside Mayor Bruce Harrell’s face. But who’s funding that campaign? According to The Stranger’s analysis of the campaign donations, almost two-thirds of their funding isn’t even coming from Seattle. It should be obvious that 1B isn’t a people’s initiative, but it’s not a Seattleites’ initiative, either. Let’s dig into it. By the Numbers Okay, let’s start with the big picture. The campaign for 1A, run by House Our Neighbors, has raised $584,740 in itemized campaign contributions, with an average contribution size of $2,367. The campaign for 1B, run by People for Responsible Social Housing (read: the Seattle Chamber of Commerce), raised $425,150, with an average contribution size of $13,286. (I hope we’re all reading that in Bernie Sanders’s voice.) The average campaign size gives us a sense of who’s funding the proposition: 1A has 182 donors who gave less than a thousand dollars; 1B has four. Long Distance Campaigning Most remarkable, though, is how little of 1B’s funding is coming from inside Seattle: 61 percent of their funding comes from Bellevue, Redmond, Mercer Island, Fort Worth, Texas, Washington DC, and Los Angeles. Proposition 1 is a City of Seattle initiative, so other cities shouldn’t have a horse in this race. But looking at where they’re coming from, the $261k in donations is all about protecting big business. Businesses like Amazon, Microsoft, and T-Mobile (totaling $220k in non-Seattle donations) hope to avoid the new tax; And those out-of-state donations? $21k of them represent the real estate industry. Meanwhile, 1A is overwhelmingly funded by Seattleites: 83 percent of their funding has come from inside the city. That, and the fact that they’re funded largely by small-dollar donations, tells us what your gut is probably already telling you: Proposition 1A is a Seattle-grown solution, funded and supported by the people who actually live here. The opposition? A corporate-backed effort bankrolled by big business and out-of-town interests who would very much prefer not to pay their fair share. Voting ends next Tuesday, February 11.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/05/02/80039738/the-downfall-of-the-climate-savior-who-never-was,The Stranger,The Downfall of the Climate Savior Who Never Was Just Can't Get Enough?,"There’s a special glee in watching the real-time, self-induced demise of the world’s richest man. Elon Musk, once crowned the boy-king of tech utopianism, has become a tragicomic emblem of what happens when unfettered power meets zero accountability and even less empathy. On Wall Street, his house of electric cards is collapsing: Tesla profits are down 71 percent, shareholders are restless, and even the once-smitten business press are using words like “panic.” And this week, Tesla’s notoriously sycophantic board reportedly—if only for a fleeting moment—considered the heretical notion of replacing him as CEO. In Washington, his soon to be concluded reign as head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) leaves a legacy of bureaucratic arson: mass firings, dismantled aid programs, and a chainsaw routine at CPAC that felt like ketamine-laced performance. And still, with the bodies of his bad decisions piling up behind him, Musk went on Fox News to cry about how unfair it all is. He’s no better than a plantation boss bemoaning the loss of free labor, or a robber baron lamenting the bad press after forcefully putting down a strike. Yet, he dares to ask for sympathy. But this isn’t just the fall of a tycoon. No, it’s the flailing, unhinged collapse of a worldview: one that treats governance like a meme, human beings like data points, and compassion as a virus to be eradicated. It wasn’t that long ago that Elon Musk was the liberal poster child for Green capitalism, the magical thinking that climate change, economic stagnation, and job scarcity could all be solved by sleek electric cars and billionaire jaunts to space. In 2015, President Obama used his penultimate State of the Union address to give Musk and his companies a glowing verbal body rub for pushing green tech innovation. Two years earlier, Obama’s Department of Energy handed Tesla a $465 million taxpayer-backed loan, which helped the automaker finally post a profit in 2013. And while liberals went apeshit when Trump turned the White House lawn into a literal “Tesla showroom” during a March event, it’s worth remembering Obama personally toured a SpaceX facility back in 2010 to show his love for public-private bromance in aerospace and renewables. Even before his courtship with the Obama administration, Musk had been glazed by progressive institutions, honored by the National Wildlife Federation, and handed the Global Green Product Design Award by none other than Mikhail Gorbachev. And before he cozied up to Trump, Musk made a brief show of conscience by quitting Trump’s advisory councils over the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord. He even declared “climate change is real” and called the move “not good for America or the world.” Naturally, that principled defiance didn’t stick. And now, Musk’s favorability rating, among everyone, not just liberals, is nestled somewhere between shingles and prostate cancer. His Teslas are dotted with Nazi insignias, and protests against him and his dealerships grow by the week. Besides gifting us gems like “Elon can oligargle dez nutz,” the nationwide protests against the world's richest man may have been the official nail in the coffin in the collective hallucinations that Green capitalism was ever a panacea for our climate and labor crisis, and that Elon Musk was ever anything more than a self-enriching opportunist. “I think the days when people thought we could solve the climate change and crisis by driving an overpriced Tesla are dead,” jokes Thea Riofrancos, Strategic Co-Director of the Climate and Community Institute. Alas, we deified Musk, only for him to unsurprisingly be revealed as a false messiah. There’s already been plenty written about Musk and his fellow tech overlords (Bezos, Zuckerberg, Andreessen), and whether they were always oligarchs in disguise, ready to buddy up beside a conveniently right-wing government (a hard yes on that one). Musk is who he’s always been, which is the same as all high-level capitalists: a self-important, mendacious fuck, willing to choose whatever path is most beneficial to him, all others be damned. As much as we’ve all basked in the collective schadenfreude over the past month—watching Teslas and Cyber Trucks get defaced with Nazi swastikas (which, for the record, is not a hate crime, no matter what the New York Times may suggest), it’s hard not to feel a little twinge of collective complicity. After all, we did allow taxpayer money to flow straight into his pockets in the first place. With Musk, we convinced ourselves we were investing in a climate Messiah, the next ""great man"" who would steer us toward a utopian green future. We imagined he would be the hero of the climate crisis, the one who would save us from ourselves. Instead, we handed him the keys to unfathomable wealth, elevating him to the point where he now wields influence on par with the president. And what does he do with that power? He uses it to decimate anything that threatens his stranglehold on the future. We didn’t bankroll a savior, we created a monster. A monster who has turned the very tools of democracy that enriched him, into weapons to dismantle democracy itself. As the Washington Post recently reported, Musk primarily built his fortune and business empire from $38 billion in public coffers, both from federal and local governments. In fact, he's drawing from the trough again as he stands to be rewarded handsomely from Trump's recently proposed $1 trillion Pentagon budget, which will enrich musk and other defense contractors, while education, arts, Medicaid, Social Security, health and everything else, not in the purview of our oligarchic overlords, stands to suffer. Of course, perhaps it's simply the playbook of most rapacious capitalists propelled up a ladder through luck, stomping on the hands of others and assistance through the public purse, only to set fire to the thing, scorching it whole behind them once they reach the top. “Tesla and SpaceX would not exist today without help from the government. People need to bear that in mind, when governments give tax breaks to billionaires, that means governments either need to spend less on other things, like schools, healthcare, and housing, or they need to raise taxes on the rest of us, so we end up paying for Musk largesse,"" says Jonathan Rosenblum, a longtime labor activist and union organizer with UAW. To Rosenblum’s point, Musk has been draining public resources long before he “volunteered” to lead the Department of Government Efficiency. Every dollar handed to Musk is a dollar diverted from essential public services: schools, transit, and healthcare. The opportunity cost of those subsidies isn’t abstract; it’s real, and it goes straight into his pockets. And it’s done at the expense of workers and unions. “Doge is merely accelerating this track record of theft. In protesting the Tesla brand, people are properly drawing the connection between Musk’s obscene wealth and his thieving ways,” says Rosenblum. It’s true that few have taken more and given less back to the public than Musk. After receiving billions in taxpayer support, Musk has built a business model on suppressing worker organizing. From illegally firing union supporters at Tesla’s California plant to targeting software workers in New York, his managers have followed a consistent playbook of intimidation and retaliation. “People are rightfully angry that the richest man in the world is collaborating with the most powerful man in the world to steal our retirements, our healthcare, and our educational opportunities. Musk is obscenely rich today in part because of the massive public subsidies he has pursued aggressively over the years,” says Rosenblum. Along with other rapacious billionaires, Musk has also led a full assault on the National Labor Relations Board over the last two years. Through his companies, Tesla, SpaceX, and X, he’s repeatedly violated labor law: threatening Tesla workers with the loss of stock options if they unionize, banning union t-shirts on the factory floor, and illegally firing employees at SpaceX and X for organizing or speaking out. These violations led to multiple rulings from the NLRB against Musk’s companies. But instead of complying with the law, he chose a path that reflects a long American tradition: when the rules don’t serve the powerful, fuck it, dismantle the rules altogether. Through SpaceX, Musk filed a federal lawsuit challenging the very constitutionality of the NLRB, which was created during the New Deal to ensure that working people, especially the most underrepresented, had a voice in the workplace. Make no mistake, this wasn’t just a legal maneuver; it was an ideological assault aimed at erasing one of the few remaining tools of federal protection for labor rights. It’s a stark reminder that in this country, the powerful often see accountability as optional, and when facing it, will do everything they can to rewrite the terms of democracy in their favor. Today, Tesla stands as the largest non-union auto manufacturer in the U.S. It’s become a model of how to scale production while locking workers out of a voice on the job. Nor is this just a domestic issue. Tesla has refused to sign collective bargaining agreements even in union-strong countries like Germany and Sweden. That’s what we’re subsidizing with our public dollars: a global campaign against workers' rights. Tesla, despite ranking ninth in earnings among U.S. automakers, commands a $1.25 trillion valuation, largely propped up by the aforementioned public subsidies. A functioning NLRB threatens that business model by giving workers a say in how those government-supported workplaces operate. By working hand in hand with Trump, Musk is pushing an agenda that would gut the NLRB, firing judges, paralyzing enforcement, and rendering union protections meaningless. The goal is clear: create a legal and political environment where companies like Tesla and SpaceX can violate labor law with impunity, silencing workers while continuing to extract billions from the public. If Musk succeeds, it won’t just be his workers who suffer, it will be a decisive blow to what little remains of labor rights in the private sector. What we’re seeing is a coordinated attack on the labor law infrastructure itself, with Musk playing a leading role. With Trump openly dismantling collective bargaining rights for federal workers, nominating anti-union lawyers like Crystal Carey to the NLRB, and firing Board members like Gwynne Wilcox to disable its function, corporate America is being given the green light to ignore labor law altogether. Utah’s recent ban on public sector bargaining and the Michigan case where an employer refused to recognize a union election, citing the chaos at the NLRB, are early signs of what’s to come. Employers like Musk are watching closely and acting quickly. If the courts uphold this unraveling of the NLRB’s authority, we won’t just witness more union-busting, we’ll see the total erosion of the right to organize in America. “Unions, when they’re doing the right thing, are the most effective force for change,” says Kate Bronfenbrenner, a labor scholar at Cornell University and leading expert on unionizing strategies. That’s exactly why she says Musk sees unions as such a threat. His attack on them follows the standard anti-union playbook: surveil, delay, intimidate, retaliate, and then challenge legal frameworks. What sets Musk apart is that he’s scaled up these tactics using the vast resources of his corporate empire along with leveraging the machinery of government to further erode labor protections. “He’s firing people in these agencies meant to keep corporations accountable so that there won’t be any checks and balances,” Bronfenbrenner says. Musk is attempting to deliver the death blow to a labor movement that’s been under attack for decades. The decline didn’t start with him; it was set in motion under Democratic administrations that claimed to support workers while advancing trade deals, deregulation, and immigration policies that weakened labor’s power. Bronfenbrenner is quick to point out that neither President Obama nor Clinton were true friends of labor. The former was the “deporter-in-chief” of immigrant workers, and the latter spearheaded NAFTA, which undermined organized labor and decimated working-class jobs in America. “Unions haven’t been holding Democrats accountable. They’ve been so scared of having anti-union folks in office that they take for granted that Dems will do right by them,” she says. “We can’t dance around the subject anymore. Labor has to have its own party and educate workers.” This is why, at a time when only 6% of private sector workers are in unions—compared to 32% in the public sector—she argues that the public must be educated on what fascist authoritarians of the past did to labor. Figures like Franco and Hitler didn’t just target marginalized communities; they first dismantled unions, understanding that weakening labor was the first step toward unleashing full-scale assaults on broader societal freedoms. “Unions have to stand up for trans workers, and immigrants. The rank and file can’t start thinking they’re safe, they aren’t. They have to have the courage to stand up and be in front of this struggle,” she says. Public protesting and shaming are fine, but what workers and the general public really need to do, according to Bronfenbrenner, is truly hit Tesla, and all corporations that would assail labor rights, where it hurts. “We have to use power, not shame. We have to interfere with supply chains. Whatever you’re doing has to cost enough to a corporation for it to do the right thing,” she says. But the fight against Musk, and whatever corporate misanthrope will come after him, ultimately boils down to whether labor can convince enough of the public that their flourishing is dependent on a greener and more democratic future. “Can’t assume workers want a revolution. Workers want better lives,” says Bronfenbrenner. Don’t we all.",,"['election', 'governance', 'budget', 'housing', 'infrastructure', 'taxes']",14.0,2025-08-04T13:23:38.315965,14076

https://www.thestranger.com/stranger-election-control-board/2025/07/07/80134055/vote-for-girmay-zahilay-for-king-county-executive,The Stranger,Vote for Girmay Zahilay for King County Executive Just Can't Get Enough?,"For more than a decade and a half, if you asked people in King County what a “County Executive” was, they might’ve said “uh, some guy named Dow Constantine?” Dow’s dynasty (Dow-nasty?) is through and it’s time for Girmay Zahilay to take charge. Zahilay, a charismatic County Council Member first elected in 2019, is already a political staple repping University District, Laurelhurst, Ravenna, Eastlake, Capitol Hill, the Central District, South Seattle, Allentown, and Skyway, but he’s never held such a powerful executive position. He can do it. And, damn it, we want him to. So do the “just fine” establishment dems like Governor Bob Ferguson, cool establishment dems like Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, and moronic warhawks like Congressman Adam Smith. Big tent! He’s also led plenty. In the five-plus years he’s been on the dais, he’s risen to current council chair and prince of fiscal management (or, in boring council speak, chair of the county’s budget and fiscal management committee. Yawn). He introduced the $1 billion Regional Workforce Housing Initiative and led the effort for a $1.2 billion property tax levy to fund mental health treatment centers. He sponsored a $2 million community-based gun violence program. He passed a five-part gun violence prevention program and supports a year-round gun buyback program. He reached these heights by knocking the legendary (read: old, respectfully) civil rights legend Larry Gossett off his perch—a big upset for an unknown lawyer from the South End who ran a nonprofit mentoring middle schoolers and came to this country as a refugee when he was 3. In our endorsement meeting, he even seemed genuinely nervous. He clearly expected our question about the child jail. In his first campaign, he made closing the detention center a huge part of his platform. But in a vote last year, he walked it back. During our endorsement meeting, Zahilay didn’t give a satisfying explanation for why he changed his mind. He says he believed the jail could be transformed with activities and community-based services. When we asked for an example of similar successes, he pointed to close-to-home facilities and “bringing the home to them through the integration of community services.” And it was a bullshit answer when there’s probably a more straightforward version: The county had nothing to replace kid jail, so the council didn’t close kid jail. This is the infrastructure we have, so Zahilay wanted to make it better. We’re not convinced that sour lemon will ever make lemonade, but Zahilay’s only real challenger in this race, County Council Member Claudia Balducci, didn’t vote any differently, and her background directing King County’s Department of Adult and Juvenile Detention is way, way more carceral. That said, these two are pretty politically aligned and did a good job at least pretending they loved each other. We like Balducci, just not as much as Zahilay. She’s a Transit Maven with political experience who is good at getting those Eastside misers to pay for things. And if we have any hope of addressing homelessness and building thousands of units of housing, someone is going to have to convince (or force) those misers to buy the biggest goose in the window (pay taxes) for Tiny Tim (us). Aside from Zahilay’s progressive zeal and résumé, we need someone in the executive's chair who, instead of facing east toward the suburbs à la Balducci, will continue to face South toward the people and places this county has long neglected. At a time the federal government is literally rounding up immigrants and refugees and saying they don’t belong, electing Zahilay is one way we can show all King County residents know they belong and they matter. And we trust he’ll do right by us all. Vote Zahilay.",,"['budget', 'housing', 'homelessness', 'infrastructure', 'taxes']",10.0,2025-08-04T13:23:38.312871,3765

https://www.thestranger.com/stranger-election-control-board/2025/04/18/80019769/vote-no-on-king-county-proposition-1,The Stranger,"Vote ""No"" on King County Proposition 1 Just Can't Get Enough?","It’s time to dig through your pile of unpaid bills and Safeway coupons. We’ve got a special election coming, and your ballot’s due on Tuesday. Let's get into it. At its simplest, King County Proposition 1 is a levy renewal. It would continue funding the Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS), a massive biometric database that stores over 3 million fingerprint and palm print records and helps police connect prints left at crime scenes to people. It also confirms the identities of arrestees, preventing people from being wrongfully detained or released under false names. On its face, Prop 1 may seem tempting enough. This is, after all, a levy with no organized opposition (as you’ll see on your ballot), endorsed by nearly all King County Councilmembers (yep, even the ones you like), and designed to renew a decades-old program that helps solve crimes and identify the dead, sometimes those beyond recognition. It’s relatively inexpensive—about $24 a year for the average homeowner—and funds forensic infrastructure across 39 cities and unincorporated King County. There’s no question that it’s better for local police departments to share a centralized, taxpayer-funded forensic system than to duplicate these services piecemeal at additional public cost. The people who currently run AFIS do seem to take privacy concerns seriously. Additionally, the system doesn’t store citizenship data, and it complies with King County’s ban on facial recognition. As of now, AFIS doesn’t collaborate with ICE (because of the Keep Washington Working Act), doesn’t scoop up facial scans, and doesn’t seem particularly interested in expanding beyond its current scope. But what if that changes? But even reasonable-sounding systems can be dangerous when left unscrutinized. Surveillance overreach isn’t tinfoil hat anymore. It’s a Tuesday. And surveillance tools rarely stay in their lane for long. We can't afford to blindly renew government tracking tools—no matter how routine—without first demanding detailed accountability, privacy protections, and public oversight. We asked Tee Sannon, the Technology Policy Program Director at the ACLU of Washington, and she flagged serious concerns about AFIS—from its potential for abuse to the lack of public transparency around how the system actually works. While the ACLU hasn’t taken an official stance on Prop 1 (they didn’t last time either), Sannon made it clear that questions about how this biometric data is managed, and what might happen to it down the line—are more urgent than ever in today’s political climate. Could this data be repurposed later? Used in ways the public never agreed to? That uncertainty alone should give us pause. AFIS is a surveillance system, and like all surveillance systems, it lives inside a criminal legal infrastructure with a long and ongoing track record of racism, data misuse, and mission creep. And right now, this system operates with little meaningful public oversight, and just as little transparency about how it impacts the communities most likely to be swept up in it. Back in 2018, we told voters to reject the AFIS levy because it came bundled with facial recognition software, tech we didn’t want then and still don’t trust now. To their credit, the county banned facial recognition in 2021, and AFIS officials say the software has been disabled. But pay special attention to that word: disabled, not deleted. Not dismantled. We shouldn’t expect the erosion of civil liberties to creep at a snail's place. Change is coming at the speed and volume of an avalanche. The federal government is hoarding surveillance powers and conducting warrantless data grabs. It’s proudly throwing immigrants like Kilmar Ábrego García in foreign prisons they may never escape. And the ICE snatch job on Rumeysa Ozturk, taken into an unmarked van by plainclothes federal agents, looked awfully like a secret police operation. Our civil liberties aren’t being chipped away at, they’re being jackhammered. So forgive us if we’re slightly suspicious of any system that collects biometric data on hundreds of thousands of people, promises it’s “just for fingerprints,” and asks us to trust that it will never, ever be used for anything nefarious. This time around, Prop 1 supporters say there’s nothing to worry about. No facial recognition. No new biometrics. No big expansion. Just a routine renewal. Just trust us. We’d be skeptical of that any day, but today? Today the federal government is pulling every lever it can find to surveil the population and amass information that can support its agenda of mass deportations—and that’s just what’s happening three months into the administration. Prop 1 allows data collected by AFIS to be shared with state and federal agencies—including the FBI—without any clear, enforceable restrictions. Once that data leaves King County’s hands, the Keep Washington Working Act (which keeps Washington law enforcement from participating in immigration enforcement) doesn’t protect our state’s immigrants. The data AFIS collects can be repurposed for uses that are opaque to the public and often hostile to civil liberties. Worse, the public has no real way to see how the system is being used. AFIS doesn’t publish regular audits or racial breakdowns of whose prints are in the system. There are no citizen oversight bodies empowered to review its operations. There are no requirements for public disclosure when policies change or technologies expand. AFIS is a biometric dragnet in an era when rights are increasingly fragile, and when the difference between “not used for this” and “can’t legally be used for this” matters more than ever. Supporters of Prop 1 argue that rejecting this levy will delay investigations, hurt cold case resolution, and force local departments to pay more for worse systems. That might be true. But that’s an indictment of how little effort has been made to rebuild AFIS into something accountable and transparent, not a reason to keep funding it without conditions. Voting no on Prop 1 is a vote demanding more from a system that has quietly amassed the biometric data of millions of people and is asking for our continued trust with almost no strings attached. We’ve said it before and we’ll say it again: Surveillance systems don’t get safer when we stop paying attention. They expand when we’re distracted. They deepen when we stop asking questions. And eventually, predictably, they turn toward us. We’re in a crisis of government, morality, and sanity right now. Anything that helps authoritarianism is worth saying no to, and finding new ways to make it work. We urge you to vote “No” on King County Proposition No 1.

Referrals to Restorative Community Pathways (RCP) are on pause for some juveniles until the prosecuting attorney's office says it sees better results. RELATED | 16-year-old charged as adult in Shoreline shooting that killed 1, injured another It was last year that Jaden Taylor, 16, was charged as an adult in the murder of a Shoreline woman. As KOMO has reported, court documents state that before this tragedy, Taylor had a referral on his juvenile record for allegedly brandishing a weapon at school. The documents allege he was sent to RCP, but he never went. ""[We] see people [in the program] who come back and are accused of really terrible crimes. We want to see that number as low as possible,"" Casey McNerthney of the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office (KCPAO) stated about the diversion program. That same program is meant to keep people ages 17 and younger charged with a first-time felony or misdemeanor from reoffending by connecting them with various community services. The program is back in the spotlight after the prosecutor’s office looked into its success rate, and after a King County councilmember's call for a program audit. LEARN MORE | King County council member seeks audit of youth diversion program after murder case The KCPAO confirms prosecutors will stop juvenile felony diversions, which are non-violent crimes, to the RCP, for now. Juvenile misdemeanor cases are still being referred to the program. ""What we want, and what I think everyone in King County wants, is a transparent program that’s really cost-effective, that shows results of people across the board- and regardless of your political leaning, people look at and say, ‘Yeah, that makes sense to me,'"" McNerthney told KOMO News. Prosecutor Leesa Manion, in a memo, told King County councilmembers the recidivism rate over the past two years was 53%, meaning more than half of the juveniles accused of non-violent felonies in the program were more likely than not to commit another crime. Seattle University Economics Professor Claus Portner analyzed the data for prosecutors and is working on a second analysis he expects to be complete in a few months. A representative with the RCP in a statement argues the sample size used to collect the data is too small to make an analysis, and that the program is a vital initiative that is working. Spokesperson Jasmine Vail adds: ""The support we offer to harmed parties, and the safety and healing we build with young people, isn’t just a smart investment—it’s a pathway to true public safety. These are the lives of young people in our community. We cannot afford to reduce them to flawed numbers."" A Juvenile Detention for Washington State report shows it costs $34,039 annually or $588 per day to house a young person in Washington, whereas community-based programs cost about $75 per day. In late July, Council Member and Budget Chair Rod Dembowski said he does not want the diversion program to be funded through a newly passed Public Safety Sales Tax, despite there being no spending plan. ""I've run amendments to cut the funding for it,"" Dembowski said.

One of the primary areas of focus is around Garfield High School, a location that has been the site of some high-profile shootings. These incidents, including one that resulted in the death of a 17-year-old student, have prompted residents to call for increased protection from city leaders. ""The principal, the families, all these folks have asked for this technology to make sure that our kids are safe,"" said Joy Hollingsworth, Seattle City Councilmember for District 3, which covers the Central District. As part of the proposed program, the series of cameras is expected to provide officers with instant information about a crime scene before they arrive. RELATED: Garfield HS students walk out, demand safer schools on anniversary of classmate's death The expansion plan includes adding cameras in the Capitol Hill and Stadium districts.

Photography is by Jake Nelson. Last month, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made two high-profile arrests in our region: Alfredo “Lelo” Juarez Zeferino, an Indigenous Mixteco farmworker activist who's been working as a berry picker in and around Skagit County since he was 14; and Lewelyn Dixon, a lab technician at UW Medicine, originally from the Philippines, who moved here 50 years ago. Both of them were transferred to the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma (NWDC)—one of the largest immigration detention facilities in the United States. These aren't the first, nor the last, people detained by ICE in Washington. While we don't have state-by-state numbers, Homeland Security says they've made 32,809 immigration-related arrests nationwide in the first 50 days of the Trump Administration, and the ICE Seattle X account practically fetishizes their local arrests, posting daily photos of people in handcuffs, facing deportation. But Zeferino and Dixon have drawn particular attention. Zeferino has been an activist for farmworker rights in Skagit County, and friends and colleagues suspect he was targeted for his activism. And Dixon, who is a green card holder who came to the US from the Philippines five decades ago, has been held for more than three weeks. Her family and her union at the university, SEIU Local 925, have been rallying for her release. Last weekend, hundreds of migrant advocates and union members rallied in front of NWDC for their release and the release of the 1,500 other detainees at the facility.

Just Can't Get Enough?,"Seattle, you’re terrible at voting in special elections. According to the county’s website, in the April 2023 Special Election, nearly 1.4 million voters were registered in King County, but a measly 30.86 percent returned their ballots. Yikes! (Compare that to the 81 percent of King County’s registered voters who participated in the November General Election.) This year, our Special Election is in February (tomorrow!), and it’s an important one. Both social housing and money for schools are on the ballot. But as of this morning, only 16 percent of registered voters in King County have returned their ballots. We have to do better! And yes, I say “we” because, admittedly, I am part of that lazy/tired/busy 84 percent who have yet to vote. My ballot is also just sitting right here, unopened and unloved. Let’s change that together! To brush up on what’s on the ballot, check out our February 2025 Special Election Voting Guide. Just wanna skip to the answers? Cool. For Propositions Nos 1A and 1B first vote YES, and then vote for Proposition 1A. We explain why in our endorsement, but for even more information on why you should support 1A, read about what we found when we dug into the contribution records. It turns out a lot of rich, non-Seattle folks and Amazon are pushing really hard for 1B. Always suspicious! For schools, vote yes on both Proposition 1 and Proposition 2. Money for schools!—even if you’re grumpy about the whole school-closures debacle. Kids still have to show up in those buildings every day; we don’t give them a choice. You have until 8 pm tomorrow to slip your ballot into one of the many ballot boxes around town (find your closest option here)! (While you can generally send it in by mail, it’s a little late in the game to guarantee it’d be postmarked in time—dropping it in a ballot box is your best bet at this point.) Not registered? There’s still time to do that, too! You can register and vote in person on election day at the King County Elections Office.",,"['election', 'housing']",5.0,2025-08-04T13:23:38.314930,2002

Jordyn Weichert, 35, has been identified as the suspect in an August 3 release by King County prosecutors. PREVIOUS COVERAGE | Man killed in stabbing, second person found dead on bus a block away The victim, identified as Ramon Aragon-Garcia, 55, was found around 6:20 p.m. on July 14, in the SODO neighborhood. A distressed man waved down King County deputies in the area for an unrelated call, telling them that his friend had been murdered in a white van. Upon entering the van, they found the body of Aragon-Garcia and a knife. According to court documents compiled during the investigation, Weichert was seen entering Ramon Aragon-Garcia's van on the evening of the 14th. Witnesses reported hearing a male voice say ""stop it"" from inside the van, and surveillance footage captured Weichert leaving the van with what appeared to be blood on her chest. The documents state that surrounding video surveillance cameras at very locations showed no one but Weichert entering and leaving the van during the estimated time before the discovery of the body. The Seattle Police Department's investigation revealed that Aragon-Garcia suffered multiple stab wounds, including to his head, face, arms, and a fatal injury to his femoral artery. The medical examiner classified the death as a homicide. Court documents note that prior to the killing, Weichert and Aragon-Garcia were known to each other and seemed to be friendly. SEE ALSO | Person of interest wanted after man found stabbed to death in van in SODO After several days spent trying to track down Weichert, including with the help of civilian tips, law enforcement arrested her on July 29. She is being held $5 million bail, and the state has requested electronic home detention with GPS tracking if she posts bail, citing concerns for community safety and the likelihood of future violence. Notably, court documents state that she has three prior convictions for vehicular homicide and two convictions for vehicular assault, all stemming from one incident. Washington state has a ""three strikes law,"" which mandates life imprisonment without parole for people convicted of three ""most serious offenses,"" which include Class A felonies. The law is meant to protect public safety by incapacitating habitual violent offenders. Vehicular homicide counts as a class A felony, which Weichert has 3 convictions of. However, the King County Prosecuting Attorney Office noted that ""convictions stemming from the same incident are not counted as separate strikes under Washington law,"" meaning that despite having 3 Class A convictions, she would only incur one ""strike"" in the system.",,"['public safety', 'police']",4.0,2025-08-04T13:25:04.014692,2889
https://www.thestranger.com/queer/2025/02/08/79911998/trump-order-causing-document-troubles-for-trans-people,The Stranger,Trump Order Causing Document Troubles for Trans People Just Can't Get Enough?,"President Donald Trump’s first two and a half weeks in office threw the lives of transgender people in the US into chaos. Through executive orders, he’s moved to ban trans women and girls from sports, ban federal support of gender-affirming care for people age 19 and younger, and set the stage for a trans military ban under the Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. But no order has likely affected more trans people than the first he signed on Day 1 of his presidency, or “Defending Women From Gender Ideology and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.” The order is a federal redefinition of sex—scrubbing all mention of trans people and trans-friendly policy from federal websites, directing federal prisons to remove trans people from the facilities that don’t align with their birth sex, banning the use of federal funds for gender-affirming care (a directive to effectively detransition those same federal prisoners who can’t get hormones any other place) and forcing trans people on Medicaid to pay for pricey drugs out of pocket. At some point, the Office of Personnel Management and Homeland Security will implement changes that require “government-issued identification documents, including passports, visas, and Global Entry cards to accurately reflect the holder’s sex.” Legal challenges are already filed, including a lawsuit from the American Civil Liberties Union challenging the state department’s “refusal to issue accurate sex designations”—these are not laws, they’re directives, and likely unconstitutional power grabs from the executive branch—but so are changes to federal policy. As we wrote last week, trans people can no longer update the gender marker on their passport or the one on file with the Social Security Administration, because, based on this redefinition, we don’t exactly have “gender markers” anymore. Instead, Trump replaced them with sex markers. His administration believes sex is locked at conception. Technically speaking, we’re nothing. We’re sexless. But the complexities, and come to think of it, simplicities, of biology, the prevalence of intersex conditions visible and invisible to the naked eye, and the demonstrable reality of gender variance in daily life, across cultures, and throughout time, is just hooey, they say. Woke, meaningless, irrelevant nonsense that must be snuffed out. We’re starting to see this ideology in practice, and it’s creating real, practical problems for trans people. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has frozen applications from people who’ve requested “X” markers or a binary change of gender, according to Denise Diskin a volunteer attorney with the LGBTQ legal advocacy organization QLaw. It now appears the only one in the business of changing gender markers is Trump: Trans people who have secured emergency replacement passports have had them returned with their gender assigned at birth. To renew a passport, applicants must send in their current one, meaning that many now find themselves without a passport and no clear timeline for when they’ll get one back. In a Friday press release, The ACLU said that 1,500 transgender people or their families had contacted the organization, reporting suspended or pending passport applications. Along with switching gender to sex on federal forms and documents, Trump’s order revoked the option for a gender neutral “X” marker on passports for non-binary people, intersex people, or anyone else who didn’t want a sex identification on their travel document. For Camins Bretts, a bald trans man with a beard and taste for expensive menswear, an “X” marker is practical. His appearance has confused border patrol agents since the 1980s. When he appeared to be a butch woman, agents saw a man fraudulently using a woman’s passport. He had the same problem after he transitioned, and really was a man using a woman’s passport. Bretts recalled all the times he’d been detained at reentry for “false documents” and laughed. “I mean, it’s a story every trans person tells me,” he says. “That’s not unique.” How he’s gendered often depends on who’s looking. The “X” marker could’ve at least put an end to consistent border troubles. On January 22, Bretts applied for an emergency passport with an “X” marker, and scheduled an appointment to pick it up on the 27th, hoping to make some last minute travel plans with friends. A few hours after Rubio reportedly sent a memo to state department employees ending the use of X markers and halting gender marker changes, Bretts’ passport momentarily disappeared in the tracking system and then reappeared three days later. At the appointment, a woman told Bretts their passport was on hold. When Bretts asked for written documentation of that, she said there was none, and no appeals process, either. Looking distressed, the woman told Bretts to print out the executive order as documentation. A supervisor nodded his head behind her. Bretts was unable to apply for a new passport under their assigned gender at birth because the Department had previously issued Bretts passports with both male and female markers. He walked away from the appointment with nothing, and no recourse, so he contacted their congressperson Pramila Jayapal and several legal organizations. On Tuesday, the Seattle passport office called to reaffirm they were not processing “X” passports. Bretts asked if that was a denial of their application, but the office couldn’t say. He’s since received notifications that their application was complete. “Called [passport] helpline,” they texted. “Still Schrodinger’s passport—‘getting ready to manufacture book and card’ according to [the] agent … They could/would not answer my q’s about when it will be ready and what gender is in it.” Evan Reding, a 24-year-old trans masculine person who passes as a cis man in daily life, says having an “F” on his passport is more of a safety concern than anything else. He hadn’t updated any of his documents prior to election day last year, but legally changed his name in December and sent in an application for a new, expedited passport on January 10th, expecting it back by at least January 31. A tracker on the State Department website shows his passport as “processing.” He checks it at least twice a day. He expects to receive a passport with an “F,” but scraping together the $600 he needed to update everything before Trump took office wasn’t easy. Reding says he wouldn’t have been able to do it without his mom’s help. The other trans people, and parents of trans children, who spoke with The Stranger asked us to use their first name or pseudonyms to protect their identities. Bailey, a trans woman also waiting for her passport, says she can afford to lose the $270 she spent, but it’s not why she went through this process. The thought that her passport may return with an “M” marker, adds to her prevailing feeling that the people in charge of this country hate her and people like her. In the months before Trump’s inauguration, 24-year-old Shiloh updated all their documents with a new name and gender marker, except the one on file with the Social Security Administration. Biggest face palm of his life, he says. It’d slipped his mind while recovering from top surgery; it’s also easy to forget. Social Security cards don’t have gender markers. They’re only visible from a SSA database called NUMIDENT, or Numerical Identification System. Shiloh evidently got lucky, or at least secured a just in time appointment with the office. They changed their marker more than a week after Trump’s order went into effect. Four days later, the SSA sent workers an “emergency message” telling them not to process gender marker changes, and to tell applicants they were “not able to accept or process a sex field change,” according to reporting from independent journalist Chris Geidner. The policy is now posted on the agency’s website. James’ daughter is trans, and they’re having trouble getting her a new passport from the State Department. They wanted to update her “X” passport to an “F,” but it’s lost in the government ether now. The family has to decide by Thursday whether or not to cancel an upcoming vacation overseas. James estimates the non-refundable hotel stay and plane tickets will be in the $10,000 range. She’s suggested staying with her grandparents if they can’t work it out in time. But money is just money, he says. But James wonders what would happen if she really needed to leave, and that passport was locked in some kind of bureaucratic morass. James has texted us regular updates about the family’s troubles. On Tuesday, they discovered Social Security processed the name change they’d submitted, but left the gender marker as “M.” That morning, he’d tried talking his way into a passport at a local office—hers was currently listed as “X.” James tried handing the employees his daughter’s updated Washington birth certificate, but says they had a record of the M on her previous passport. “They have no guidance on how to issue one otherwise since X doesn’t exist anymore,” he wrote. “I think having a passport, regardless of gender is better than no passport and being stuck.” The employees were compassionate, and heard him out even though he did not have an appointment, but there was nothing they could do but escalate his problem to their supervisor, who told him to come back with his daughter on Wednesday and submit a new application with an “M” marker. While waiting, he says he overheard employees tell a trans woman that the process had changed, and they’d mail her a passport. She flew in from Alaska, he says. James returned with his daughter on Wednesday, they were told the legal department would have to review her application. He had to write a letter explaining their situation. “I have to go back Friday and either there will be a passport or a letter from legal denying it.” James got neither. The passport office called Friday and explained they were still waiting for guidance, meaning his daughter's passport would remain in limbo. James cancelled the first leg of the family vacation. If things change, they’ll rebook. If they don’t, well, he isn’t so sure. Liz’s trans son came out shortly after the family moved from Seattle to rural Washington. She joked that he should have come out when they lived someplace with resources. But they’ve managed. “Surprisingly,” she said, he’s not the only trans kid. There’s a small community of families like theirs. He’s out at school. His identity is not a secret. Anyone who knows him knows he’s trans, which didn’t stop his civics teacher from polling his class on whether broad acceptance of trans people would be very bad for society. Eighty percent of them said “very bad.” Liz submitted a passport application for her son with an “M” marker on December 23, and arrived a week later on January 1. Liz paid for expedited service, and says the online tracker showed it would arrive in two to three weeks. Five weeks later, it still hasn’t. The tracker shows it is “in process.” Liz thinks her son’s delayed passport has been overwhelming for him, but his main concern is missing out on a trip to Asia this spring. He doesn’t understand the gravity of the situation in the way she does. No one around her seems to. She says it’s as if people almost expect trans people to be discriminated against. They don’t see these orders as extreme as they should. “The thought of an American citizen being denied this and that being okay with people—not just my son, but all trans and non-binary kids and adults,” she says. “To oppress a whole group of people on a federal level. That’s what scares me.”",,"['election', 'policy']",4.0,2025-08-04T13:23:38.313899,11638
https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/06/14/80100983/everything-you-want-to-know-about-protesting-in-seattle,The Stranger,Everything You Want to Know About Protesting in Seattle Just Can't Get Enough?,"There are two major protests planned in Seattle this weekend: one that starts in Cal Anderson Park and plans to march to Seattle Center, and another at the University of Washington's Red Square. Meanwhile, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has said that it's preparing to deploy its Special Response Teams to five cities run by Democratic leaders, including Seattle. This is a lot! So we talked to local attorneys and advocates to help protesters figure out how to show up, mitigate their risk of arrest, and stay safe. How can protesters choose to mitigate their risk of arrest? The highest risk of arrest comes when police issue dispersal orders—which typically happens if they believe there’s a risk of riot, disruption, or a threat to public safety (which leaves a lot of room for police discretion). “In Seattle, police officers are obligated to announce their instruction to protesters to disperse,” one local attorney told The Stranger. “If you hear them do that, you should disperse if you want to avoid being arrested. But, officers don't always make that announcement audibly (or at all), and sometimes don't allow crowds time and room to disperse. In that event, you should maintain self-awareness for your personal safety and comfort level. If you feel the tension around you start to rise, or you see officers begin to change their body language toward interacting with the crowd, you may want to find an exit route quickly.” If you’re at a protest, there’s a good chance that you’ll interact with police at some point. “Plan ahead,” says Katie Walker, the communications director from CAIR-WA. “Police interaction is stressful and all planning helps keep all participants safe. Use de-escalation techniques. Identify group liaisons for law enforcement and make sure all group members know who is chosen. Identify and support group individuals who may have specific exposure concerns.” “When interacting with law enforcement: Stay calm,” Walker says. “Make sure to keep your hands visible. Don’t argue, resist, or obstruct the police, even if you believe they are violating your rights. If you can safely do so, point out that you are not disrupting anyone else’s activity and that the First Amendment protects your actions.” If arrested or detained, when should a protester speak to law enforcement? Attorneys and advocates gave us a very short list of words she suggests people say to law enforcement: ""Am I free to go?"" If the answer is “yes,” go. If it’s “no,” tell them, ""I would like a lawyer."" Then say nothing. “If you start talking to the cops, even chit chat, you are potentially waiving your right to remain silent,” Danni Askini from Gender Justice League (GJL) says. “Unless your life is in imminent danger and they are in a position to save your life, remain silent at all times.” “There's no reason to speak to law enforcement at a protest, and it's absolutely okay not to,” the local attorney told The Stranger. “There is nothing you can say to a law enforcement officer that will improve your situation or the situation of anyone around you.” Can law enforcement require you to share identifying information? “If you are just at a protest, under Article 1 Section 7 of our state constitution—no, police cannot demand to see identity information or demand your name,” says Askini from GJL. However, you must identify yourself “if you are under arrest and an officer can articulate probable cause that you have committed a crime,” Askini says. Then “you are required by law to give your legal name or you can be charged with obstruction of justice.” What can a protester do to protect their privacy, especially in regards to technology? “Be as analog as possible,” the local attorney told us. “If you can make a plan with your people to meet up at a certain location if you get separated instead of relying on texts, do that. Make an arrangement with someone at home that if you're not home by a certain time, they should check the King County Inmate Lookup to see if you've been arrested. If you need your phone, make sure it's locked with a passcode, not facial recognition or a fingerprint, and keep it on airplane mode as much as possible.” Walker from CAIR-WA recommends that if you keep your phone, turn off all location services, don’t use digital payments like Apple Pay or credit cards, cover cameras when you’re not using them, disable Bluetooth, and don’t scan QR codes or connect to public wifi. “Cell phones are spies in your pocket,” says Askini from GJL. “They place you at the scene of a potential crime, can be collected and shared with federal officials who may later decide to prosecute people in the vicinity.” As we head into a summer that could be full of protest action, Askini suggests that people “consider purchasing a MeshTastic device, setting it up with friends, and creating a mesh network to communicate with each other. We are moving into a totalitarian era, we should all be more mindful” Facial recognition is a thing. How can protesters protect against that? Are protest mask bans enforceable? “People have a right to cover their faces in Washington State and there are no specific laws prohibiting masks in public,” Askini says. “There are no state laws that explicitly ban face coverings at protests. However, if you engage in vandalism/assault and are caught, concealing your identity could be argued by prosecutors to be an aggravating factor.” Who should a protester call if they are arrested or detained? Most people we spoke to recommended the National Lawyers Guild at 206-OK-TRY-ME (check their instagram for hotline hours before you go). “They should also have a very trusted friend, family member, or ally who is prepared to take action if they are arrested,” says Askini from GJL. “Since you may only get one call, you should prepare the person on the outside to make several calls on your behalf.” What steps should a protester take if they feel their rights have been violated? “Start documenting as soon as you can,” the local attorney told us. “Write down what happened step by step. Remember the 5 Ws [who, what, where, when, why], but also record details, like which side of the street you were on, what time it was, what you remember about the appearance or statements of the officers, etc. Your thoughts will be jumbled, but that's okay. Ask a friend to take notes and help you get organized so you can just flow.” In terms of other documentation, they say, “take photos of any injuries you have and write down how you feel over a few days. Often injuries don't appear immediately. Get a medical exam as soon as possible so that you have a medical record of your injuries as well. Don't worry so much about whether the law was broken or not—just record all the information about your experience as soon as you can, and worry about the legal part after a few days.” “Make sure to put this in an envelope and mail it to yourself or have it printed and notorized - Having a time stamped ""contemporary account"" of your experience can be helpful in the future. This is also important for any time you may be interviewed, appear in court, or be put before a deposition,” says Askini from GJL. “I'm not going to lie, getting justice after a mass arrest can be demoralizing, frustrating, and slow,” says Askini. “After a protest at the 2004 Republican convention in NYC, I was arrested, put against a wall in an alley, and repeatedly peppersprayed while being handcuffed. It was 10 years before the City of New York settled the lawsuit related to the mistreatment of arrestees. What it took was patience, persistence, and an unwavering commitment to secure justice.” Should protesters avoid posting to social media? “Reasonable minds can differ on this,” the local attorney says. “I tend to think protest social media is best left to the many journalists and livestreamers who are set up to document protests. But, if you do want to document your view of the protest, for example, if you want to livestream or document police violence happening in front of you, I recommend turning off location data and blurring the faces of any other protesters you capture if you can. We know for sure that law enforcement uses social media to locate people they want to target, sometimes days or weeks after the event. With all kinds of image searching software available and frequent cooperation between social media companies and law enforcement, your private profile may not actually be very private, and you don't have control over how your social media post might be used once it's up.” Is it safe for immigrants to protest in Seattle this weekend? “All non-citizens can be negatively impacted by interactions with law enforcement,” says Walker from CAIR-WA. She suggests carrying identity documents on your person, and for temporary visa holders, review the restrictions on your visa. “Safety is relative. Immigrants are only as safe as law enforcement and ICE will allow them to be,” says the local attorney. “Washington's Keep Washington Working Act prohibits local and state law enforcement from cooperating with ICE, but that doesn't mean it's not happening, unfortunately. And, we can expect ICE to be in the streets as well as local law enforcement. Undocumented immigrants are at the most risk if they are arrested, but anyone who is documented but on a conditional status like waiting for a citizenship interview or an asylum hearing may also be at risk of an arrest damaging their application. We know the Trump administration has cancelled the visas of protesters as well. It's a very personal decision, but I think anyone without citizenship should think through their decision really carefully.” How can other protesters support immigrant protesters? “I think people can start by considering how their actions may or may not put other protesters at risk of arrest,” says Askini. “I've been to probably more than 100 protests since 1998. I've seen a lot. When white protesters escalate violence with police in the presence of non-violent protesters who are immigrants, BIPOC, or trans, they are assuming that other people will have the same experience in the criminal legal system as they will if there are mass arrests, and they won't.” “Before you go, look up strategies for de-arresting people, and practice with your protest group,” says the local attorney. “If you're white and a citizen, put yourself between law enforcement and BIPOC folks as much as possible (if an arrest is in process, be careful to either not interfere or prepare to also be arrested). Even if you're just marching or rallying and the police are just standing around monitoring, put yourself on the outer edge. If you do see someone being arrested by ICE, ask them their name before the officers take them, try to get the badge name or number of the arresting officers, then contact WAISN or NWIRP with as much information as possible about where the arrest took place and the name of the person so they can provide support.” What steps have you personally taken to protect yourself and others when attending protests? “I believe in having a designated police negotiator, a clear press spokesperson, and a clear message!” says Askini. “The worst case scenario is when mass arrests begin and people who are not intending to get arrested for an action get swept up in mass arrests. While people can see negotiating with the cops as somehow ‘collaborating,’ I see it as a diplomatic endeavor that can stall arrests, extend the protest, ensure solidarity and allow people to make decisions for themselves about if they want to be arrested or not. I believe in doing our best to be strategic in our approach—while the crowd can react, situations can escalate, having a plan with things like legal observers, medics that are clearly mapped, press that are nearby to document and report, and clarity about who is in command of the protest is vital.” “When I go, I make sure to mask, and I wear comfortable shoes and I usually have my bike helmet with me (I like riding there so I can exit quickly if I need to), some gloves, and a couple of bottles of water and snacks,” says the local attorney. “But the biggest thing I bring is my mindset. I think the most damaging thing I can bring to a protest is the idea that a protest has to be ‘peaceful.’ Protests are, by definition, disruptive. When protesters start policing each other and coming in with a mindset that a protest has to be ‘peaceful, it shifts the accountability for police violence away from police and toward other protesters. We don't have to all want to use the same tactics in order to be in solidarity with each other.” If you are an organizer, what protest tactics do you hope to see this weekend? What do you hope people will avoid? “I understand the desire of protesters to fuck shit up, but I truly hope to see less escalatory ‘taking the bait’ this weekend,” says Askini. “The Trump Administration wants an escalation so that they can pull a Reichstag Fire and call in the national guard and military. Why take the bait Seattle? We are smarter than that shit. Out smart the police and feds. Lots of smaller protests all over the city grinding things to a halt is WAY more disruptive, smart, and difficult to manage. Avoid direct confrontations. Keep it bussin! Stay on the move and don't get bogged down in one location. The most annoying protests are ones the police and authorities can't predict.”",,"['public safety', 'police']",4.0,2025-08-04T13:23:38.310866,13433

The fire, which is human-caused, continues to burn in steep and rugged terrain, posing challenges for firefighting efforts. PREVIOUSLY | Level 3 evacuation orders issued for Bear Gulch fire burning in Mason County Increased humidity has helped moderate the fire's growth, but firefighters remain engaged in both day and night operations to protect structures and other critical values at risk. The fire has crossed Copper Creek, and crews are using sprinkler systems around cabins and structures while removing flammable materials to reduce fire potential. Efforts are underway to enhance road systems east of the fire to make them more defensible, and crews are identifying natural features northwest of the fire to halt its northward progression. Drones are being used for reconnaissance and to strategically apply fire to remove fuels from the advancing main fire. On the southern portion of Lake Cushman, crews are accessing remote sections by boat to protect structures, timber, and power infrastructure. Five helicopters are supporting these operations. The fire is expected to persist in the Daniel J. Evans and Mount Skokomish Wilderness areas until extinguished by fall rains and snow. Weather conditions remain warm and dry, with light winds and moderate humidity recovery. Cooler conditions and light showers are anticipated late next week. Lake Cushman has been closed to public use in support of suppression and evacuation efforts. Campfires are prohibited in Olympic National Forest and Olympic National Park, and all outdoor burning is banned in Mason County. Numerous road, trail, and campground closures are in effect for public safety. Detailed information on Olympic National Forest closures can be found HERE. Evacuation orders are in place, with the Bear Gulch Fire area near Dry Creek Trail under a Level 3 ""GO"" evacuation, including the Staircase Campground. Areas south of Dry Creek are under a Level 2 ""BE SET"" notice. A Temporary Flight Restriction is in place over the fire area.

The undeveloped land is in the Westwood Highlands neighborhood, where not everyone is on board with the $30 million plan to build single-family homes. RELATED | Bellevue School District faces state oversight over budget shortfall, depleted reserves Following the district board sign-off on Thursday, Bellevue schools says it plans on entering into an agreement to sell off the wooded property to Tri Pointe Homes. School officials at the district board meeting explained the more than 10-acre parcel is no longer needed and is unfit for developing a school, while the superintendent said this deal is going to ""accelerate the district's path to financial recovery."" ""We have other properties at our disposal if we should, in the future, need to engage in the construction of another elementary school,"" BSD Chief Operating Officer Dr. Heather Sanchez explained. The $30 million proceeds will speed up the district’s new financial recovery plan by restoring the general fund reserve. The district has been under binding financial conditions with the state since July as it faces a budget crisis due to dropping enrollment, a loss of state funding, and boosted operating costs. ""Part of the reason it comes down to selling the property is not just to spend on our regular costs, but it’s also to make sure we have a reserve, which we have depleted, in order for us to come out of binding conditions,"" added Board Member Jane Aras. ""That has to happen first."" A new state law allows any Washington school district under those conditions to add the profits from a one-time sale to the district's general fund instead of the capital budget used for building projects and technology. However, not everyone supports this move. One Bellevue neighbor off camera pointed out that 139th Ave. SE is the only inlet to that property. He worries that having any development could create traffic back-up on his quiet neighborhood street. Board Member Monica Webster said while the development's impacts on the neighborhood are still unclear, the school district will be responsive to people's concerns. ""The district does plan to stay attentive to any potential adjustments that might be necessary at those surrounding schools in that area if there is a need for that,"" Webster stated. The school district hopes to close the sale before Spring 2027. Also starting in 2026, another new state law - HB 2049 - allows the district to increase the local levy collection by $500 per student. That amounts to about $5 million for the coming school year and is expected to generate $10 million every year after that. The superintendent said this land sale deal, combined with the local levy, will help BSD restore its budget in two to three years instead of the seven to 10 they had anticipated. People will be able to weigh in when the district has a public hearing on the budget on Aug. 21.",,"['budget', 'development', 'budget (title)']",4.0,2025-08-04T13:25:04.014692,3122

It’s Seattle’s own, first-in-the-nation public campaign financing program. And Proposition 1 asks if we want to renew the levy that funds it for another decade. The new levy would be funded through a property tax, and it’s expected to raise $45 million over 10 years, costing the average homeowner $12.20 a year. By most metrics, the DVP has been a roaring success. It makes primaries more competitive and campaigning accessible to more diverse candidates, and the vast majority of people running for office in Seattle participate in the program. More than 106,000 Seattleites have slipped their vouchers to candidates, and according to the City, through 2024, we’ve distributed more than $10 million to local campaigns. It’s difficult to find opponents to the DVP (the opposition statement is written by right-wing radio host Ari Hoffman). But supporters of the program still have complaints. The most common concern is that when we introduced the Democracy Voucher Program (which limits the amount of money a candidate can accept), spending from lobbyists skyrocketed (which remained unlimited). But lobbying spending has shot up across the region, not just here in Seattle. And even if it did push lobbyists to up their game, it's also one of the few tools we have to combat them. There’s a reason that there isn’t any organized opposition to Proposition 1. It’s a new, promising program that deserves time to shake out its minimal kinks and prove to other cities that it’s worth it. Our democracy is already under attack. Now isn’t the time to defund one of the projects that makes democracy just a little bit more accessible. Vote yes on Proposition 1.",,['candidate'],3.0,2025-08-04T13:23:38.321978,1935
https://www.thestranger.com/queer/2025/02/04/79905654/fucking-political,The Stranger,Fucking Political Just Can't Get Enough?,"On July 3, 1981, the New York Times announced the coming plague with a short news item tucked into Section A, Page 20: “Rare Cancer Seen in 41 Homosexuals.” Nobody knew the purple Kaposi’s Sarcoma lesions the article described were the mark of a virus that eviscerated the immune system and left the body vulnerable to opportunistic infections. A quote from the dermatologist Dr. Alvin E. Friedman-Kien described the outbreak as “quite devastating.” Millions would die from what doctors first called GRID, or Gay-Related Immune Deficiency, a name that linked gayness with death. But when it became clear the mysterious illness affected people other than gay men, it was renamed AIDS, or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome. A French virologist discovered HIV in 1983, but the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention wouldn’t list it as the sole AIDS-causing agent for another two years. Ten more years passed before researchers announced a breakthrough: protease inhibitors, the first truly effective HIV medication. Patients who could tolerate the drugs astounded their doctors. Some were pulled from the brink of death. They called it the “Lazarus effect.” AIDS arrived just 12 years after the Stonewall Uprising. Anonymity gave way to a radical vision of public parades and sexual freedom. Many felt fucking in bathhouses, bookstores, public parks, and clubs were not just revolutionary acts, but part of a revolutionary responsibility. This sentiment collided catastrophically with HIV. The virus first consumed gay men in sexually liberated New York and San Francisco. Cases climbed exponentially in 1981, and the epidemic soon exploded. Men who seemed healthy on a Wednesday could be dead by Sunday. Nurses and doctors were disgusted and afraid of the illness and the people who had it. They allowed patients to languish in soiled bed sheets and die alone, while bigoted visitation policies separated them from friends and lovers. In the first story about AIDS to air on a major television network, 27-year-old Ken Ramsauer told Geraldo Rivera that he heard nurses’ aides outside his hospital room speculating “how long the faggot in 208 is going to last.” Ramsauer died four days later. The explanation for why young, healthy gay men were dying was years away. With little outside help, the community devised its own solutions, including a brand new idea called safe sex. Dr. Joseph Sonnabend recommended a biopsy the day he discovered swollen glands all over Richard Berkowitz’s body. Berkowitz, who’d left grad school for a more lucrative gig as a sadomasochistic master to suburban men, didn’t take his doctor’s advice until learning another hustler had died. Berkowitz soon yanked his ads from the Advocate, a national gay magazine, and cut his business line. When Dr. Sonnabend, who had already suspected the coming epidemic, fingered similarly hard lymph nodes on Michael Callen’s neck, he weighed his favorite patient’s promiscuity against his likelihood of musical success, and told him to leave New York, prompting an angry reaction. Callen, after a phone call from an apologetic Sonnabend, agreed to donate a small blood sample for Sonnabend’s study of gay men of a similar profile: swollen glands, a history of STIs, and no lesions. Tests revealed a compromised immune system. Callen called home and told his parents he’d be dead of cancer in six months. Dr. Sonnabend eventually connected his two patients, who shared a desire to spread the word and a belief in their doctor’s “multifactorial” theory of AIDS. Sonnabend theorized repeated exposure to STIs and human cytomegaloviruses, which cause chickenpox, herpes, and mono, better explained the total immune collapse than the emergence of a new virus (the then-unknown HIV). He saw sexual liberation as enabling this death by one thousand cuts. Callen and Berkowitz concluded gay men did not know the possible danger of sex. Feeling a responsibility to sound the alarm, they published “We Know Who We Are” in the New York Native, a gay newspaper in Greenwich Village. Warning readers against sex in bathhouses, they wrote, “What ten years ago was viewed as a healthy reaction to a sex-negative culture now threatens to destroy the very fabric of urban gay male life … the obvious and immediate solution to the present crisis is the end of urban gay male promiscuity as we know it today.” The backlash was instant and scathing. As author and former Native staff writer David France wrote in his 2016 book How to Survive a Plague, the men were called “sex-negative hysterics” and “self-flagellators” in the paper’s subsequent editions. Articles in the Village Voice denounced them. An editorial printed in a Toronto gay paper accused them of spinning 200 diagnoses of “GRID” into a crisis, pointing out that twice as many gay men had died in traffic accidents in the same time period. Callen and Berkowitz were, of course, right—AIDS was sexually transmitted and gravely serious—but sometimes it’s not what you say, but how you say it. The inspiration for one of the earliest safe sex guides for gay men came with a bang at Berkowitz’s door. A former client had driven from Connecticut in a frenzy to ask if Berkowitz was okay. Berkowitz, who explained what AIDS was, expected the man to freak out. Instead, he asked if Berkowitz would put on his leather and boots while he jerked off. “I was in shock!” Berkowitz told The Stranger in a phone call last month. As a sex worker, Berkowitz could imagine a more expansive sexual world, where sex could take many forms. His client reminded Berkowitz safety and enjoyment were not mutually exclusive concepts: “It was an education to me to see how many different ways there were for men to get sexual pleasure that had been haunting them, that they were craving for, where they can access it and pay for it and not be ashamed of it.” With help from Dr. Sonnabend, Berkowitz and Callen started work on a booklet they called How to Have Sex in an Epidemic: One Approach, published in 1983. Dr. Sonnabend insisted the booklet begin with a scientific rationale for gay men to alter their sexual behavior. Callen and Berkowitz followed that explanation with practical advice. While the science is dated, the nonjudgmental, sex-positive tone is contemporary. People would continue having sex regardless, so they encouraged readers to treat their partners with love (even for a night) and their own health as precious. The guidance met people where they were at. For instance, Sonnabend noticed his patients who were bottoms who liked being fucked were more likely to get sick. The authors advised readers on the risks of receptive anal sex. They acknowledged that some gay men were defensive about these warnings because of homophobic stereotypes. (“Remember that the issue is disease—not sex,” they wrote.) They explained that sperm could carry a virus and infectious agents can easily penetrate the rectal lining. Providing a condom to your partner was the best way to stay safe, they advised. For tops who couldn’t adjust, they suggested another compromise: “Let your partner fuck you without a rubber and make sure that he either pulls out or puts a rubber on before he cums.” How to Have Sex in an Epidemic provided similarly frank guidance on ethics and responsibility, selecting partners, washing up before sex, buying and selling sex, blowjobs, fist fucking, no-risk methods like mutual masturbation and fingering, dildos, and S&M. They addressed the reality that men with AIDS were having sex: “AIDS patients are human beings and need affection and human contact. AIDS patients object to being treated like lepers and some end up taking this anger and frustration out to the baths and backrooms. The issue of AIDS patients having sex must be viewed from two perspectives: the risk to the patient and the potential risk to the partner.” France, author of How to Survive a Plague, remembers the booklet changing the culture in New York City nearly overnight. “It was night and day,” he said. “It didn’t just give you the rules of things to not do, but it said, ‘This is how we can build a life’ in this incredibly dark time.” Unbeknownst to Callen and Berkowitz, a protesting band of nun habit wearing drag queens in San Francisco called the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence came to the same conclusions about safe sex and condom use the year before. The Sisters’ 1982 zine “Play Fair!”—black, white, and pink and illustrated with comic nuns—introduced readers to STIs like syphilis, herpes, hepatitis, and intestinal parasites, as well as Kaposi’s Sarcoma and pneumocystis pneumonia, two symptoms of the “severe problems with immune systems” arising for gay men in large American cities. (The Sisters also added “guilt” to this list, “SYMPTOMS APPEAR: 2 to 3 years of age and persist in many cases throughout one’s life.) It’s possible that one booklet written by two AIDS patients and their doctor, and another written by drag queens, saved thousands of lives, and that their influence is still felt in every bowl of condoms in a gay bar or health clinic in America. (Moreover, we have a guy from Connecticut with a leather kink to thank). The concept of sexual harm reduction influenced mainstream medicine. While scientists cracked the biomedical puzzle of HIV, AIDS still kills. Even as researchers develop evermore effective HIV treatments, including injections that can replace months of daily pills, advancements are meaningless without access. Basic human problems of poverty, homelessness, and convoluted healthcare systems have stymied efforts to end the pandemic. (Such a thing is possible. In 1980, the World Health Organization eradicated smallpox, one of the most deadly illnesses in human history, through vaccination). Donald Trump’s administration is radically hostile to public health and bodily autonomy. Just weeks into his term, he’s already threatening HIV medications for people outside the US. Trump through PEPFAR, which supplies HIV medication to 20 million people in poor countries. Stopping these medications can eventually kill or lead to the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Through executive order, Trump withdrew the US from the WHO, ending decades of our international collaboration on healthcare. A gag on health agencies ability to communicate with the public, the possible freeze on federal grants, the anticipated cuts to programs that do not align with Trump’s ideological priorities, and (as of publication time) possible Senate confirmation of vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the nation’s healthcare system, are all worrying signs that this administration is a threat to accurate health information and equitable access to healthcare services. That’s true for straight people as well. Trump revoked Biden’s executive orders that directed the federal government to protect access to abortion. For queer Americans who grew up in an era of widely available, government-subsidized drugs to prevent and treat HIV infections, waiting for a treatment that may never come as friends, lovers, and gay rights pioneers sickened and died is nearly unfathomable. People lived for years without knowing HIV caused AIDS. They lived 15 years without a truly effective drug, by which time the virus had killed at least 343,000 people in the US. For much of that time, gay people still lacked many fundamental rights and contended with federal and local government officials indifferent to their suffering. Sodomy was still illegal in many states, and public opinion was not with gays. The Christian right saw gays as physically and spiritually contaminated, and AIDS as biblical justice. Still, people with AIDS gave the last weeks, months, and years of their lives working toward a future they might not see for people they would never meet. Their political courage was rewarded with one brighter than many could have imagined—for a time—but look where we are today. We should take lessons from the early AIDS activists who took matters into their own hands. The story of AIDS, and gay rights, is often told as David slew Goliath, that gay rights triumphed over bigotry and brought the government and its institutions to a heel. But for years, community response kept people safe. Alive. We now face the possibility of the government abandoning an even wider swath of the population. We’ve taken responsibility for our care before, and it worked. But it is not 1981. We need to decide what that looks like in 2025, keeping key lessons in mind: Progress is not linear, political victories are not final, and territory, once claimed, must be vigorously defended. Who you are can decide whether the government helps you, or potentially hurts you. When systems fail, help the people around you. Passivity and inaction are non-options. Small actions can be meaningful, even the smallest gestures, or simply occupying space. Sister Roma joined the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence in 1987 after a chance encounter at Midnight Sun, a bar in the Castro. In walked a character who looked like a showgirl nun. Gregarious, flirtatious, and smiling, Sister Luscious Lashes ordered a drink from a bartender she clearly knew. Roma thought she hadn’t seen anything like her when she walked over and called Roma by her “boy name,” which she never uses anymore. This nun was her good friend Norman Schrader. Sister Roma was ushered quickly into the order, and fell in love. Looking back to her years in San Francisco before the Sisters, Roma said she acted like she was in a “gay candy store,” where life revolved around partying and boys. “I must have been insufferable,” she says. “But when I met the Sisters, it was like my head exploded. I was like, ‘Oh my God, I care about my civil rights. I care about my community. I want to help people’ Even though I was raised sort of Catholic and went to a Catholic college, never was I raised to have any kind of spirituality or be of service until I met these crazy fucking drag queen nuns.” Schrader later died. But Roma and other Sisters continued patrolling the Castro, putting condoms in the hands of strangers in bars. They sought sick people, hunched over cocktails in the dark, and engaged them in conversation. Sometimes these men would ask for hugs. The Sisters always said yes.",,"['homelessness', 'parks']",3.0,2025-08-04T13:23:38.319974,14274

On Tuesday, the organization filed a Personal Restraint Petition on behalf of Amber Kim, arguing that placing her in a men’s prison, where she is more likely to experience harassment and sexual violence is cruel under state constitutional standards. The petition requests that the state transfer her back to the Washington Corrections Center for Women. ""DOC has stripped her of her humanity by taking her from the women's prison, where she was really, truly excelling, and put her in a place that we know will harm her, both physically and emotionally,"" says ACLU of Washington staff attorney Adrien Leavitt. ""She has a history of physical abuse, sexual abuse, harassment, and emotional abuse in the men's prisons. We know that from studies that trans people are at huge risk of all of those things. It's not, sadly, like we're not guessing about whether that will happen to Amber, because we know it's already happened to her."" The Washington DOC said that they do not comment on pending litigation. This March, an officer at Washington Corrections Center for Women (WCCW) in Gig Harbor discovered Kim and her roommate having consensual sex in their cell, which is against prison rules. The women were removed from their cell, separated, and placed in restrictive housing. At a disciplinary hearing, both Kim and her roommate were found guilty of a “504 Infraction,” a prison ban on intimacy. As punishment, both women were placed in closed custody, adding supervision and confining them to cells for longer than usual. Then, someone at the DOC leaked Kim’s disciplinary report to the conservative National Review, which published an account that played on sensational, right-wing tropes of trans women using their identity to get into bathrooms, changing rooms, and prisons for sexual gratification. (In March, the DOC said it was trying to find the leaker). Her life was less salacious. The infraction was her first and only write-up in the three-and-a-half years she lived at WCCW, where she attended college and tutored other inmates. Documents show Kim’s mental health improved after her transfer, and she reported other inmates treated her like any other woman. She told counselors she no longer wanted to give up on life. Here the women’s punishments diverged. Months after her roommate left closed custody, Amber remained anxiously waiting without explanation. Her fears were realized when a DOC counselor allegedly told her the DOC was considering transferring her back to a men’s prison, a move the department had never made before. DOC policy allows it to remove inmates from gender-affirming housing if there are “documented, objective safety concerns.” After the infraction, a multidisciplinary team at WCCW reviewed Kim’s housing placement. WCCW Superintendent Charlotte Headley and others determined Kim should remain at the women’s facility, finding she was neither abused or an abuser in her time there. Five weeks later, the DOC reversed its decision. The DOC only adopted its trans housing policy in 2020, and since then only 11 out of the roughly 250 trans people in the system had entered gender-affirming housing. The DOC allows trans people to stay where they are if they want to—some have communities and relationships worth keeping—but the transfers are not a given, and granted on a case-by-case basis with fuzzy parameters. 504 Infractions are not uncommon, and sex is a reality of prison life. The DOC recorded 33 in the years Kim lived at WCCW, but she remains the only person transferred for one, and the only trans person in Washington removed from gender-affirming housing. On June 21, when corrections officers restrained Kim with a seatbelt-like device for a two-hour ride to Monroe Correctional Complex, where she arrived exhausted and unable to stand. According to the lawsuit, officers claimed Kim had tried to bite them, but rescinded the allegation after video evidence obtained by Disability Rights Washington showed she hadn’t. When Kim arrived at Monroe, she learned the DOC planned to place her in TRU, a unit of primarily sex offenders, former gang members, and a small number of transgender women. Fearing for her safety, Kim went on a 17-day hunger strike, only suspending it for a gender-affirming tracheal shave. How the DOC May Have Violated Kim’s Rights The ACLU’s case draws from Robert Rufus Williams’s 2021 case before the Washington State Supreme Court, which sought relief from cruel conditions in the height of COVID. Leavitt says the Williams case in particular set an important precedent when it found that Washington’s State Constitution provides greater protections than the United States Constitution. In this case, Kim is sentenced to life without parole for murdering her parents. The ACLU argues that when statistics and Kim’s life experience shows harassment and the threat of sexual violence are omnipresent in male prisons, confining her to one violates her state constitutional right, without a valid penalogical reason to do so. Leavitt says the DOC may have a goal of tightening prison security, but housing Kim with men does not accomplish that. Statistics support Amber’s own documented history, showing the elevated risk for trans women in men’s prisons and jails. The Bureau of Justice’s 2015 National Inmate Survey found 35 percent of trans people in prison, and 34 percent of trans people in jail had been sexually assaulted within a year of their incarceration. It also found transgender inmates were nine times more likely to experience sexual harassment and assault than cis inmates. The US Trans Survey, the largest dataset of trans people in the US available, found trans inmates were five times more likely to be sexually assaulted by prison staff, and nine times more likely to be sexually assaulted by inmates. Thirty-seven percent of incarcerated trans people self-reported that they were assaulted in prison, compared with 3.4 percent of the cis population. The Prison Rape Elimiation Act even contains specific protections for gay and trans people. These statistics are not hypothetical for Kim, who has been incarcerated since she was a senior in high school. Even before her transition, Kim was slim and feminine. Men taunted her with slurs. After her transition, they propositioned her. At one point, she says men had passed her enough notes asking for sex to fill a brown paper lunch bag. Most of these notes included a time the men would be waiting for Kim in the showers. She kept track of these times to avoid running into them. When Kim complained to a job supervisor in prison that a coworker, convicted of sex offense, was aggressively pressuring her for sex, she was fired, according to the lawsuit. Male corrections officers allegedly inappropriately touched her breasts during pat downs. According to the suit, she eventually reported her experiences saying that she did not “feel safe” in a men’s prison. She still doesn’t. In August, during a transfer from Monroe Correctional Complex to Airway Heights for a gender-affirming procedure, male inmates yelled sexual comments and slurs from the seats behind her. Others debated the existence of trans people. Upon her return to Monroe, Kim told DOC she would not enter the general population, where she would face a Catch-22. Hormones alleviate her debilitating gender dysphoria, but the more feminine she becomes, the more unwanted attention men would give her. Years before the Williams case, the US Supreme Court found that the Eighth Amendment protects incarcerated people from cruel and unusual punishment. In 1989, Dee Farmer, a Black trans woman imprisoned in Terre Haute, Indiana was brutally beaten and raped in her cell. She sued prison officials for mental anguish, psychological damage, and humiliation. The justices ruled unanimously in Farmer’s favor, finding prison officials created an “objectively intolerable risk of harm” and acted with “deliberate indifference to this harm.” In Farmer’s case, officials knowingly placed a young, non-violent trans woman to a maximum security prison, and disregarded that risk. According to the ACLU, tens of thousands of cases have cited Farmer. But “deliberate indifference” is hard to prove in court. In Washington, you don’t have to because this federal standard falls short of our state protections. The court decided this when Robert Rufus Williams brought his Personal Restraint Petition at the height of COVID, seeking relief from cruel conditions under the state constitution. Williams, a 77-year-old Black man with diabetes, hypertension, and complications from a stroke that immobilized his right side, had been kept in a “dry” cell without a toilet or sink. When waiting for staff to wheel him to an accessible bathroom, Williams urinated in bottles. He struggled to keep himself clean. This State Supreme Court found failing to meet Williams’s basic sanitary needs did not meet penological goals of retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation in violation of Article 1, section 14 of the Washington State Constitution. The justices also concluded that the “deliberate indifference” standard assumed that poor conditions can only be considered punishment if a prison official subjectively intended them as punishment, or that cruel conditions can arise from “institutional policies and practices just as readily as from intentional acts by individual prison officials.” This established a subjective, two-part inquiry for inmates challenging their conditions in Washington far more protective than the federal precedent set in Farmer v. Brennan. To be granted relief, the decision found, inmates must prove “(1) those conditions create an objectively significant risk of serious harm or otherwise deprive the petitioner of the basic necessities of human dignity and (2) those conditions are not reasonably necessary to accomplish any penological goal.” Since Williams, no one has been granted relief based on cruel conditions of confinement, and Kim’s case is likely the first to challenge how the DOC houses trans people on that standard. “What we can infer from the Washington State Supreme Court’s discussion of Dee Farmer’s case is that Washington State would not tolerate Dee Farmer’s conditions of confinement,” Leavitt says. “Our state would be more protective of her, and I think that’s profound, especially as we compare that with Amber’s case right now.” Kim’s Life in Isolation The degree to which Kim’s life has worsened can be measured in absolute terms: She’s gone from being a full-time college student with friends to sitting in solitary confinement. But it’s clearest in her voice. Her affect is flat over the phone in Leavitt’s office. She’s calling on a tablet from her cell. Every few sentences, the signal fizzles to an electronic garble. “I’m definitely feeling the weight of isolation,” she says. “I will not even pretend to be psychologically okay.” She can’t hug friends because she’s not allowed contact visits. She has three books and video games on her tablet, but lives mostly in isolation, cycling from her cell, to the shower, to the unit yard—a small concrete room with a chin-up bar. She believes other prisoners don’t know she’s there, as they’ve taken to harassing another trans woman in her cell block who catches “no end of shit.” As Kim told The Stranger this summer, the irony of forcing a trans woman into a men’s prison, supposedly to stop sex from happening, is that the life of a trans woman in a men’s prison is a barrage of sexual harassment and slurs. The abuse worsened as her transition progressed, and only wavered when she had a boyfriend, a calculated trade of sex for safety. This time, she’s traded freedom for safety. As she wrote in an affidavit, “If I am eventually placed in men’s general population, I will live in constant fear.”",,"['housing', 'policy']",3.0,2025-08-04T13:23:38.323982,12157

https://www.thestranger.com/queer/2024/12/30/79845003/trans-immigrants-how-to-change-your-name-and-gender-markers,The Stranger,Trans Immigrants: How to Change Your Name and Gender Markers Just Can't Get Enough?,"The maddening experience of the average transgender US citizen is nothing next to the average transgender immigrant’s journey navigating the US immigration system. The government has clear answers for how trans citizens can change their gender markers on documents, at least until Donald Trump takes office and eliminates Joe Biden’s trans-friendly policies. It can be daunting and bureaucratic. Simple errors can derail you. But for the most part, citizens mail in generic forms, snap a photo, pay, and receive their documents in a few weeks. The process is straightforward and basically the same for everyone. For immigrants like you, lawyers told us what’s best depends on who you are and where you came from. To give an extreme example, the US is less likely to grant asylum to an undocumented transgender woman from Barcelona or Paris (I haven’t met either of you, but I’m sure you’re out there), as it would be to a Russian, Ugandan, or Honduran fleeing from danger in their home country. While we did our homework, and spoke to qualified lawyers, if there’s a law degree on our wall, I haven’t seen it. The best we can do is write a helpful, informed guide. For legal advice, speak to an immigration attorney. If you don’t have one, consider seeking low-cost or pro-bono immigration legal services in your area. Malou Chávez, executive director of Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, warned immigrants against trusting notarios, or people without law degrees who present themselves as experts of immigration law. Notarios exploit target vulnerable immigrant communities in times of confusion, like when the government announces changes to its process. “It could go different ways, but mostly it’s completing forms and providing advice even though the person is not an attorney,” she said. “Be cautious.” Though generally speaking, the advice for trans immigrants is the same as it is for trans citizens: Update your gender on federal documents while you can. The incoming Trump administration will likely make it harder to do so when it eliminates self-attestation, or the ability to proclaim your gender without a medical evaluation. We can’t be sure what exactly could change, but Trump has said that on day one of his presidency, the US government will adopt the position that there are only two genders, which he’s previously said are set at birth. For the time being, you don’t need a doctor’s letter to change the gender marker on all but one federal immigration document. If you’re applying for asylum, it may even help your case. If you’re undocumented and don’t have any forms to update, there’s a path forward for you too. None of this comes cheap. Updating your name and gender on USCIS documents can cost upwards of $495), and can’t be done all at once. Here’s how the US-CIS can make you US-Trans. If You’re Undocumented Find yourself a lawyer and file an asylum case, says Ava Benach, the founding partner at Benach and Collopy in Washington, DC. Her firm has handled hundreds of asylum cases for trans people. A trans identity makes for a strong claim because, despite the constant legislative attacks of the past four years, the United States remains one of the safest countries for trans people in the world. A trans Central American walking from Guatemala or El Salvador is not passing through many places they’d be free from a well-founded fear of persecution. “If you’re a trans person who’s come into the country in the last year, get yourself to a lawyer and consider applying for asylum,” Benach says. “But if you have been here longer than a year [and missed the deadline to file form I-589], there are commonly accepted exceptions to that rule.” Those exceptions include a person not identifying as trans until they’d lived in the states, starting hormone replacement therapy, updating identity documents, or an HIV diagnosis, which is statistically more common in the trans community and grounds for persecution on its own. Immigration attorneys say it’s common for immigrants from countries hostile to LGBTQ people not to explore their identity until they’ve been here for some time—either because it wasn’t safe or because in their culture, queer identity was flattened into a broader category of “something someone should never be.” Sometimes it’s masculine lesbians and feminine men figuring out their true gender identity, other times transgender men and women realize non-binary better describes them. These things take time and experience to discover, which doesn’t change the reality that deportation after transition could be dangerous—making a strong case for asylum. Trans people ineligible for asylum could instead qualify for withholding of removal, an alternate, less stable pathway of protection which allows someone to stay in the US indefinitely on a work permit. While withholding blocks the government from deporting a person to their home country, the US still has the ability to send them to another country that would take them, Benach says. Kelsey Shamrell-Harrington, managing attorney at LGBTQ immigrant legal services organization Entre Hermanos, says there’s growing consciousness among immigration judges that gender identity is fluid, especially for those escaping bigotry. It can depend on where the court is located, but “you’d be surprised,” she said. Her clients often ask if a judge will discriminate against them if they change their name or gender during asylum proceedings. “The US government is not authorized to discriminate against somebody because they’re trans,” Shamrell-Harrington says. “Being a transgender person generally means you’ll be more vulnerable for future violence. For that reason, I try to discourage people from letting the fear of what government officials think prevent them from living their truth, especially when their truth can be ultimately so protective for them.” Under current USCIS policy, LGBT are members of a protected group whose persecution makes them eligible for asylum. The Biden’s administration has already severely restricted asylum eligibility. A process made more difficult by Democrats will be made even worse by Trump. Project 2025, which we should consider a policy model until proven otherwise, calls for “asylum reform,” to eliminate expedited pathways, raise the standard for credible fear of persecution, and eliminate the “vague and overbroad” protections for social groups. But Trump won’t have ultimate power. He can initiate mass deportation without congressional approval, but making the changes suggested by Project 2025 would require action in the House and Senate. Not that that’s out of the question. Come Inauguration Day, conservatives will control all three branches of government. And like last time, Trump is likely to pack the courts with federally appointed judges sympathetic to Making the Bench Great Again. Fortunately, any changes will face lawsuits (and the last Trump administration lost lawsuits all the time). Remember Plants vs. Zombies? The next four years are going to be like that, but with lawyers throttling unjust law and policy. All the same, this oncoming shift is one of the compelling reasons undocumented trans people should consider filing for asylum today. Even if government workers want to accept these claims, they’ll have their marching orders from Trump. The biggest risks for any undocumented immigrant are detainment and deportation, but Benach says the danger is acute for trans immigrants, particularly undocumented trans women, who have suffered in Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers. Anything that initiates a criminal process, from arrest to conviction, can draw ICE to an undocumented immigrant, and a significant number of trans people rely on sex work to pay the bills. The National Transgender Discrimination survey found 13% trans people have done sex work. The majority are trans women, who report discrimination keeping them out of other jobs. The risk of arrest could grow as more states consider criminalizing trans people from using single-gender facilities like bathrooms. Still, being trans in and of itself is not grounds for deportation and Trump is not prioritizing their removal. “If there’s going to be raids, it’s going to be at meat processing plants and construction sites. It’s going to be in buildings full of undocumented people,” Benach said. “If you don’t get arrested, chances are you’re not likely to become a target.” If You Are Documented In March 2023, US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) updated its policy manual to accept self-identified gender markers for people requesting immigration benefits, and that gender marker does not need to match supporting documents. (At present, and likely for the foreseeable future, USCIS will only offer binary gender markers). USCIS provides instructions for correcting Arrival-departure records, employment authorization documents, permanent resident cards, and various travel documents. Applicants do not need to supply proof of their gender, with the exception of those replacing their naturalization certificate. If you have an employment authorization form or Green Card, you should also update your gender marker with the Social Security Administration. It’s free. Naturalized citizens should also update their US passports. Attorneys said they could think of very few instances where updating any of these documents could put someone in harm’s way—mostly having to do with how soon after a person submitted their forms after an arrest or conviction when they’d be better off laying low than catching the attention of the immigration authorities. If you’re seeking asylum and authorized to work, updating your documents could even help build a persuasive argument if it’s consistent with your case and your story. In many instances, it’s totally neutral. Even though the USCIS handles all these forms, changing each one comes with a slightly different process and price. The agency doesn’t change them all at once, lawyers said. Immigrants do not need to change all these forms–in fact, mismatched markers between USCIS documents are okay. In some cases, immigrants may not want to change them, either. For instance, most people aren’t presenting their arrival-departure records on a daily basis and travel documents are sometimes one-off. For some, it may be safest to avoid changing these: Border guards are not primarily known for friendliness and understanding, and if the gender marker on the passport from your home country does not match the gender marker on your USCIS-issued travel documentation, you could run into trouble when leaving or re-entering the country. Lawyers say to prioritize the documents you share with your employer and the authorities: Employment Authorization and Green Cards. Although you probably don’t keep a Naturalization Certificate rolled up in your pocket for daily use, you can change it. Immigration law is hard to DIY. Some immigration attorneys say you should consult your immigration attorney before you file any documents, while others say you can probably manage these steps on your own. If in doubt, send an email. Your immigration attorney probably has an opinion, too. Looping in an attorney won’t slow or accelerate the process. Everyone is subject to the same processing times. Fees vary from document to document. Here’s the department’s latest fee schedule, which is subject to change. Changing the Name or Gender Marker on your Employment Authorization Document For those who don’t know the ins-and-outs of this process, an employment authorization document (EAD) is what it sounds like: A document that allows foreign nationals to work in the US. But these physical cards serve the same important purpose as any photo ID. They’re typically valid for one year, and can be renewed at the halfway mark, six months before they expire. That’s as good a time as any to update the gender on this document. To update your gender marker on an employment authorization document, submit form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization. If you’re renewing your EAF, try to submit this document at least 180 days before your current card expires (if you apply early, USCIS automatically extends authorization for 540 days). Check the box that suits you. At $495, this necessary annual expense is not cheap. When filling out the form, check filing category 1.b. Replacement of a lost, stolen or damaged EAD not due to USCIS error. With your form and filing fee, submit supporting documentation including: Depending on where you’re from—or if you’re a refugee, or asylee, a student, etc.—the USCIS might want something more from you. Check the special requirements here. If you’re eligible, you can file online here. If you can’t wait because you’re worried about Trump changing USCIS policy before it makes sense to renew your EAD, you can request a replacement from USCIS with the same form. If you don’t have an online account, you can also contact updategenderinfo@uscis.dhs.gov to request a correction to your name or gender marker. USCIS will ask you for the card with your old gender marker. Wait times for a new document may vary. Attorneys gave us different answers ranging from a minimum of three weeks to 11 months, depending on why you qualify for a work permit. Typically, they say the process is l shortest for asylum seekers and longest for parolees. To update your name on an employment authorization form, you will submit all the same documentation as you would for a gender marker change—plus a court order after you legally change your name in a District or Superior Court. (In Washington, name changes are automatically sealed in Superior Court). You don’t need to be a citizen to change your name in the US. Once you have a court order, provide it to USCIS with your application to renew. USCIS may ask you for a letter explaining why you’re changing biographic information. You shouldn’t expect to be asked for “proof” like a doctor’s letter, but it does happen. “Not to call anyone out, but I’ve seen it more from Texas,” says Kelsey Shamrell-Harrington, managing attorney at LGBTQ immigrant legal services organization Entre Hermanos. Seven out of ten times, her trans clients can update their gender no problem. It’s those three other times the department asks for documentation. USCIS will accept basically any letter from a medical professional confirming you are who you say you are. If an LGBTQ health clinic or LGBT-aware general practitioner is prescribing you hormones, they likely deal with this for insurance all the time, and would be able to quickly email one to you. Advocates for Trans Equality has this sample letter as well. Additionally, if you are scheduled for an interview with USCIS based on a pending application, you can also update your gender marker in person. That includes removal proceedings. Malou Chávez, executive director of Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, says asylum seekers should know their employment authorization and case are linked. If you update your gender or name on your card, make sure to update the court’s records as well. “That’s just different things attorneys and advocates know,” she says. “The process is so complex. While one person may not necessarily need an attorney to replace documents, it’s always advised. Presumably the attorney knows to think about all the different questions and possibilities.” An asylee can inform USCIS of a change to name or gender during one of those meetings. But if it’s far enough out, your attorney could also file a motion to amend your name and/or gender in the court’s records. “They’ve been very receptive to that,” Shamrell-Harrington says. “I’ve mostly practiced in the Seattle office. So if you’re practicing in Georgia, your experience may be different.” Changing the Name or Gender Marker on your Green Card. File form I-90 and pay the $495 fee to replace it. Under Part 2 of form I-90, or “Application Type,” check box 2.e., “My name or other biographic information has legally changed since the issuance of my existing card.” Look under “Specific Instructions” on page three of this form to determine what supporting documents USCIS requires from you. It depends on who you are and how you got here. For example, marriage-based Green Cards require marriage certificates, and employment-based Green Cards require a job offer. Generally though, prepare scanned photocopies of your current Green Card (front and back), valid passport (opened to the page with your photo and personal information), Social Security Card, and birth certificate. If USCIS requests an original copy of a document, the department will send it back to you. You’ll also submit the Green Card with your incorrect information. You can file online here. If you’re just changing your gender marker, check male or female. If you’re changing your name, see Item 4. Check yes and proceed to items 5.a. to 5.c. On the form, provide your name exactly as it is on your current Green Card. Along with your supporting documents, provide the court order from your legal name change in District or Superior Court. (Like all government forms, you can’t change your name on a permanent resident card until you’ve obtained a court ordered name change). Changing the Name or Gender on Your Naturalization Certificate File form N-565, along with the $555 filing fee and the supporting evidence outlined in this document. As of April, the government allows people to change their gender marker to X. To change your name, you’ll also need to provide a court ordered name change. To change both your name and gender, USCIS requires: If you’re applying from overseas and provide a foreign address, the department will send your new naturalization certificate to the nearest consulate, embassy, or USCIS field office to your address. You’ll get a letter telling you where to pick it up. Is This Going to Put Me at Risk? This is by far the most common question we’ve received. Many trans US citizens and immigrants alike are concerned changing their name and documents will put them on a government list, but according to every single expert and trans advocate that we’ve spoken to about this for months, in this rare instance, not fitting into the system benefits trans people. Changing your name or gender-marker on government documents will create a record of some kind. Federal agencies don’t process gender-marker changes with special gender-marker change forms. They’re the same generic forms everyone uses for applying and renewing. The federal government likely won’t be able to search for those specific records without an expensive overhaul to their databases. Why spend the money when surveilling social media is a easier and faster way to find trans people? That’s not to say delete your social media, but it's helpful to stack concrete vulnerabilities against the government actions of our nightmares. Plus, as advocates pointed out, statistics show trans people who carry documentation that doesn’t match their appearance are at risk of violence already. “Somebody needs to balance their own immediate day to day safety against the hypothetical risks,” said Olivia Hunt, policy director at the National Center for Trans Equality. According to the 2015 US Trans Survey, the largest dataset on trans people in the US currently available, nearly one-third (32%) of trans people who presented an identity document that did not match their presentation experienced discrimination, denial of service, and violence. But risk is a personal assessment. If you’re anxious, consider pushing through the feeling and ask what you’d do if you weren’t afraid. Ultimately, only you know the right answer.

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2025/06/16/80103956/almost-10-percent-of-seattle-marched-at-no-kings-rally,The Stranger,Almost 10 Percent of Seattle Marched at No Kings Rally Just Can't Get Enough?,"Ever wonder what 10 percent of Seattle’s population looks like? If you came out to the No Kings rally on Saturday, you found out. An estimated 70,000 protesters gathered at Cal Anderson for a rally, where Rep. Pramila Jayapal, labor leaders, immigrant rights advocates, and federal workers all spoke. “This is gonna require a lot of us. We have to adjust ourselves. We have to dig even more deeply,” Jayapal said. “I’m not ashamed to say I’ve got moments of fear. Of course I do, and so do you. But you and I are more than afraid. We are furious.” After the speeches, the rally snaked down Pine St., spanning almost two miles from end-to-end. The “No Kings” branding was strong, but less memorable than Seattle’s handmade signs: “I hate big crowds up I hate fascism more;” “ICE=Gestapo (btw that’s bad);” “Aspire to live like a Tsar, plan to go out like one.” One woman carried a head on a bloody pike wearing a rubber pig mask, crown and blonde wig. It’s true that the Hands Off and No Kings marches are easy and accessible. They’re not radical whatsoever. At the same time, they’re undeniable evidence at least 5 million Americans find Trump’s policies intolerable: Americans head-to-toe in black, with keffiyehs around their necks, in yoga pants, or with children on their hips, all acting as a single counterpoint to Trump’s failed show of authoritarian military power in Washington DC. Crowds were so sparse and quiet the squeak of tank wheels could be heard on livestreams of the parade. Now, if the marches really are just a pretext to raise funds for a toothless Democratic party, or these signs are left to collect dust like all the pink hats from the record-breaking Women’s March, they very well may be meaningless. But they can also act as an invitation for people to do more than show up once, post on their Instagram story, and call it a day. Marches like this are nice, but they’re the beginning of resistance, not the end. From a stage at Cal Anderson, King Youngblood’s Cameron Lavi-Jones told the crowd voting in local elections could help protect their neighbors, but their “presence cannot just stop at the polls.” “For those that are able—we need you to show up and disrupt the spaces where injustices are taking place in front of our eyes. Including the rallies and protests that are not as comfortable as this one,” the 26-year-old rock musician said. One of those protests was happening 10 miles south of the park: In Tukwila, protesters made a blockade across the facility’s exits out of homemade shields, no parking signs and their own bodies, hoping to keep two immigrants from being taken into detention in Tacoma. Around 3 pm, Tukwila police and the ICE SWAT team used at least two different types of chemical weapons on the small crowd in order to break through. As the march made its way from Cal Anderson to Seattle Center, Marsha, 78, told The Stranger she was visiting family in Seattle from Tuscon, and joined the march. Before No Kings, the last two protests she’d been to were the 2017 Women’s March, and Selma. “What’s happening is appalling,” she said, “that you arrest and trample on the rights of the poorest people, the people that have the least resources, and that you demonize them.” Daniel, a chef, showed up because he isn’t able to keep his employees safe. He says he feels powerless, but “I feel like if we unite as people we could do more.” Hibi, a Somali immigrant who came to the US as a young child, and has lived in Seattle for more than a decade. “Once he left office, we felt like things were going to get better,” she says. But she wasn’t too surprised when he was reelected. She and her immediate family are documented, and have been for years, but she says two family friends were detained at the Tukwila ICE office less than two weeks earlier. They came to the US seeking asylum, she says. “I’m not really hopeful a lot will change,” she says. “But I’m hoping.” Nationwide, the ACLU estimated that some 5 million people marched in all 50 states. Most were lowkey and peaceful, but there was still a backdrop of violence across the country. Earlier that morning, a gunman approached two state lawmakers' homes wearing a latex mask and a police uniform. He shot and killed former Democratic State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark; He also shot Democratic State Senator John A. Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, who both survived. When Boelter was arrested, authorities found a list of about 70 potential targets, including politicians, civic and business leaders, and Planned Parenthood centers. In Utah, a man entered the crowd with what appeared to be an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle, and when armed “peacekeepers” fired at him, they shot and killed a bystander, 39-year-old fashion designer Arthur Folasa Ah Loo. And in Texas, law enforcement arrested one person connected with a credible threat of violence against local politicians that planned to attend the No Kings march in Austin, the state capitol. Meanwhile, federal law enforcement cracked down on anti-ICE protests. In Los Angeles, police fired flash bangs and tear gas into protesting crowds, and at federal buildings in the city, US Marines guarded federal buildings with rifles, and ICE SWAT teams reportedly tackled at least one protester to the ground.

The incident began when a Sanders observed a white work truck traveling at 53 mph in a 35 mph zone on Steilacoom Road. SEE ALSO | VIDEO: Thurston County deputies use grappler to stop 130 mph chase on I-5 The truck nearly rear-ended another vehicle, passed it in a no-pass zone, and then sped away. Sanders tried to initiate a traffic stop, but the driver refused to pull over, fleeing to their driveway. Sanders said that upon exiting the truck with a drink in hand, the driver refused to cooperate with commands and tried to run inside their house. The sheriff reported that the suspect ""doused me in the face and eyes with what smelled like sweet liquor,"" leading to a physical altercation. During the struggle, the suspect grabbed the sheriff's vest, turned off the radio, and ripped off the lapel mic. The suspect also grabbed the sheriff's throat. A taser was deployed but failed due to the close proximity. A nearby neighbor intervened, helping Sanders subdue the suspect. A K9 arrived on the scene and bit the suspect on the ear, prompting the suspect to surrender. The suspect was placed in a WRAP restraint system due to continued threats and resistance. A warrant was obtained to test the suspect's blood for intoxicants, and he was taken to the hospital for medical clearance. The suspect will face charges including reckless driving, DUI, felony assault on a peace officer, obstructing, resisting arrest, failure to obey a police officer, and driving on a suspended license. The suspect's family told the TCSO they had offered him a ride home from an event, which he refused, and that he did not have permission to drive the family company vehicle. The decision was made not to impound the vehicle, as the family needed it for their livelihood. The neighbor who assisted the deputy was awarded a Sheriff challenge coin for their swift action.",,['police'],2.0,2025-08-04T13:25:04.014692,2390

Two of the shootings happened within hours of each other early Sunday morning, one in Seattle's SODO neighborhood and the other in South Seattle. The first incident took place around 4 a.m. Sunday near 1st Avenue South and South Dakota Street, where officers found a man shot in the chest and a juvenile hit in the leg. The man later died at the hospital. The juvenile remains hospitalized in serious condition but is expected to survive. Detectives reported that multiple shooters might have been involved, and several guns were recovered at the scene. Just two hours later, a second man was found shot dead in a parking lot off 4th Avenue South, near a wrecked sports car. Investigators are not yet confirming if the cases are connected but are examining the timing and proximity of the incidents closely, officials said. The increased police presence has been unsettling for those working in the area. ""I just come to work, clock in, do my job but seeing this I wouldn’t say it’s a shock to the system but it is a shame,"" said a local worker. ALSO SEE: The weekend's violence follows a deadly shooting at a church near the University of Washington late Thursday night and another earlier in the week at the Northgate Transit Center. In response to the surge in gun violence, Seattle Police Chief Shon Barnes has called for community action and collaboration. ""Achieving this goal requires collaboration between the criminal justice system and the community. We encourage everyone to report any indicators of potential violence they may observe,"" said Chief Barnes in a statement on preventing gun violence. Chief Barnes emphasized that community tips will be critical leads for detectives, especially early in the investigation. Authorities are also reviewing surveillance footage from both shooting locations from Sunday. Anyone with information is urged to contact the Seattle Police Department.",,['police'],2.0,2025-08-04T13:25:04.014692,2186

https://www.thestranger.com/news/2024/12/19/79832605/having-an-iud-is-great-getting-one-can-be-terrible,The Stranger,Having an IUD is Great. Getting One Can Be Terrible Just Can't Get Enough?,"The appeal of the IUD is undeniable: When you can get pregnant and don’t want to, 10 baby-free years feels like a miracle, something you’d be willing to suffer for at least a little. But for a lot of patients, the pain that comes with an IUD insertion is way more than “a little.” And worse, the pain is often downplayed by providers—if it’s even addressed at all. When Rep. Amy Walen (D-48) accompanied a young woman to an insertion appointment, she found this lack of pain control horrifying. So horrifying that she’s prefiled a bill for the upcoming 2025 legislative session addressing it. House Bill 1077 would require clinicians to discuss pain management with patients before IUD insertions. Walen hopes her bill will raise awareness about the very real pain that can accompany this extremely routine procedure: IUDs are one of the most popular forms of long-acting birth control on the market. She wants to keep other people from experiencing the intense pain she witnessed in the patient she accompanied, whose pain was intense and unrelenting. “It was really, really upsetting how painful it was for her,” said Walen. With state legislatures across the country understandably focused on abortion access since the reversal of Roe v. Wade, it’s unusual to see policies like Walen’s, which specifically focus on IUDs. But maybe it shouldn’t be. If you’ve ever gotten an IUD—or talked to a fellow drunk girl in a bathroom line for just a little too long—the pain that can accompany an insertion is not new information. When I surveyed IUD users—or would-be users—about their experiences most recently, I was immediately flooded with responses describing “mind-bending pain,” prolonged failed insertion attempts, repeated uses of the word “brutal,” and comparisons to things like “a small dragon … trying to claw out of my body for 24-36 hours.” These were concerning, but they were also deeply familiar. Stories like these are the subject of casual conversations over brunch or a beer. One friend of mine described pain that lingered for days after her insertion. Another, who fainted during her appointment, attempted to put a positive spin on things: “One shining silver lining was my nurse was a hot dyke and caught me when I fell off the table and I woke up in her arms,” she said. Removal was memorably bad, too, for a former colleague of mine. “When having it extracted, my doctor (and an intern) couldn’t get it out,” she said. “He spent 30 or 45 minutes yanking on it from various angles as I tried not to scream.” My editor knows a woman whose first IUD insertion was so painful that years later, when she returned to get it replaced, she had a full-blown panic attack. Her body was so tense that they weren't able to safely complete the procedure. Even women who’ve given birth describe the pain of IUD insertion on particularly gnarly terms. Elinor Jones, better known as the celebrity gossip columnist at our sister paper the Mercury, described an insertion attempt that had to be stopped because it was so painful it was “like knives.” Annie Jurrens, who’s been through two unmedicated births, described her IUD insertion as one of “acute pain, like being stabbed in an internal organ.” Given the grim state of reproductive health care in America, stories like these—where things really devolved, but no one died or was permanently injured—might seem like minor inconveniences, hot nurse or not. And juxtaposed with the horrors visited upon people who had first-generation IUDs like the infamous Dalkon Shield, perhaps they are. A claw-like device with a sci-fi name, the Dalkon Shield’s design led so many users to develop pelvic inflammatory disease that it became the subject of one of the largest tort liability cases in history. It’s an unqualified good thing that the Dalkon Shield is off the market, but its existence seems to have set the bar in hell for future IUD experiences. You wouldn’t know this from the next-gen IUDs’ branding, ensconced in the soft focus of marketplace feminism, with imaginary girls’ names that sound like they’re written in cursive on a wooden sign inside HomeGoods: Skyla, Mirena, Kyleena. (The eminently practical ParaGard is the only exception to this: As the oldest and only non-hormonal option in the gang, the copper T is like the used Subaru hatchback of IUDs, and I mean that as the highest praise.) Despite this rosy marketing—and the very real pain they felt—the IUD users I spoke to said they received little or no advance warning that their procedures might be painful. Some were told just to take ibuprofen beforehand, others weren’t even given that advice. One was told scheduling the insertion during her period would make it easier, “but it just resulted in the whole fiasco being an absolute bloodbath,” she said. There’s a reason for this bizarro dissonance between brutal patient experiences and provider attitudes toward pain management and support: Research suggests that patients and providers perceive the pain of IUD insertion differently. A 2015 study published in The European Journal of Contraception & Reproductive Health Care found that while most IUD insertions “appeared acceptable to most patients,” providers “tended to underestimate the degree of pain experienced by their patients during IUD insertion procedures.” That could be changing. Earlier this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidelines for clinicians inserting IUDs to encourage conversations about pain management with patients before the speculum comes out. The CDC now recommends the use of topical or injected lidocaine, which numbs the cervix. Misoprostol, also used in medication abortions, may be helpful for some patients, but it’s not suggested for typical use. It’s not clear what role, if any, legislative policies like Walen’s will have in advancing these updated clinical guidelines, beyond drawing attention to them. Sarah Prager, an abortion provider in Seattle, was skeptical of the approach. “There already exists a lot of guidance around offering/providing pain management for IUD insertions (including newer advice from the CDC within the Medical Eligibility Criteria (MEC) for Contraception Use (published updates this year),” she said. “I 100% agree expanded options for pain management should be offered/available, but I disagree that legislation is the appropriate vehicle for achieving this.” But one thing is always worth remembering: A good doctor (the kind you deserve) will realize you’re in pain, and do something about it. “I was ready to power through,” said Jones. “I am grateful for my (female) doctor being like ‘You are in too much pain and I don’t recommend continuing.’” But if you’re at the doctor’s office and something is painful, you’re allowed to speak up.",,['legislation'],1.0,2025-08-04T13:23:38.312871,6780
